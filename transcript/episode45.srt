Hi, and welcome to another
episode of the cloud architects

11
00:00:58,390 --> 00:01:02,740
podcast my name is Nicolas Blank
and I'm here with my co host.

12
00:01:02,770 --> 00:01:03,610
Christopher Goosen.

13
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:04,480
Chris Goosen: Hello.

14
00:01:06,580 --> 00:01:10,390
Nicolas Blank: Today we have a
guest which we featured on the

15
00:01:10,390 --> 00:01:12,460
show before Michael Van
Horenbeeck

16
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:13,540
Michael Van Horenbeeck: Hi,
everyone.

17
00:01:14,710 --> 00:01:18,220
Nicolas Blank: Welcome to the
show. And thank you so much for

18
00:01:18,250 --> 00:01:24,460
appearing again. We are excited
that there's something that you

19
00:01:24,460 --> 00:01:30,490
are launching fairly soon, and
it's a book. So without wanting

20
00:01:30,490 --> 00:01:35,380
to spoil too much, why don't you
tell us what your book is about

21
00:01:35,410 --> 00:01:37,420
and why you've decided to write
it?

22
00:01:37,960 --> 00:01:41,770
Michael Van Horenbeeck: Sure. So
the book is called Microsoft 365

23
00:01:41,770 --> 00:01:46,390
security for IT professionals.
And some of you might recognize

24
00:01:46,390 --> 00:01:50,320
that the title kind of resembles
the office 365 for IT

25
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:55,600
professionals book, um, which is
done on purpose. A couple of

26
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:59,440
years back Tony Paul Cunningham
and I we started a venture

27
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:02,980
Adventure I should say of
writing a book which is kept up

28
00:02:02,980 --> 00:02:06,370
to date on a monthly basis, the
office 365 for IT professionals

29
00:02:06,370 --> 00:02:11,080
book. The reason why we started
that journey a couple years back

30
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:14,680
is because the cloud is moving
at lightning speed updating you

31
00:02:14,740 --> 00:02:18,460
almost on a daily basis. So
trying to create a book which

32
00:02:18,460 --> 00:02:22,390
isn't outdated from the day that
you publish. It was an

33
00:02:22,390 --> 00:02:25,780
interesting challenge. And I
believe I wrote for the Book

34
00:02:25,930 --> 00:02:30,310
Three, four years after original
work life got in the way so I

35
00:02:30,310 --> 00:02:34,570
kind of dropped off as a as an
author and an entire team took

36
00:02:34,570 --> 00:02:38,920
over from Paul me. And, you
know, there's a whole author

37
00:02:38,920 --> 00:02:43,630
team out, but still you I like
to write. In the meantime, I

38
00:02:43,630 --> 00:02:46,690
also switched over to the
security side of things where

39
00:02:46,750 --> 00:02:49,000
over the past couple of years,
all I've done is security,

40
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:52,540
security, security. And I
noticed there wasn't really a

41
00:02:52,540 --> 00:02:56,290
security book in the same space
or following the same model kind

42
00:02:56,290 --> 00:03:00,010
of keeping up to date on a
monthly basis. And you know,

43
00:03:00,010 --> 00:03:02,680
With the focus from Microsoft on
everything, you know, security

44
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:06,730
and compliance, there's a ton of
stuff that's changing really

45
00:03:06,730 --> 00:03:10,000
like a lot of that. So I
figured, you know, let's bring

46
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,820
on that challenge. Let's try and
write a book and keep it up to

47
00:03:12,820 --> 00:03:15,820
date at the same pace. But
rather than focusing on the

48
00:03:15,820 --> 00:03:19,450
productivity side of things,
just focus on the entry 65. and,

49
00:03:19,480 --> 00:03:22,990
by extension, a little bit of
Azure Security as well. And

50
00:03:22,990 --> 00:03:26,320
that's how we got to the book,
which, by the way, we should be

51
00:03:26,320 --> 00:03:28,390
releasing very shortly.

52
00:03:29,430 --> 00:03:32,190
Chris Goosen: That's, that's
super exciting, I think, for a

53
00:03:32,190 --> 00:03:36,690
number of reasons. Right? I
think, one, I think that most

54
00:03:36,690 --> 00:03:39,780
people or at least a large part
of the audience will understand

55
00:03:39,780 --> 00:03:44,910
or know of the office 365 for IT
pros venture and the work that

56
00:03:44,910 --> 00:03:47,340
you and Tony and everyone have
done on that because it really

57
00:03:47,340 --> 00:03:51,420
is the standard as far as you
know, a book of knowledge around

58
00:03:51,420 --> 00:03:55,080
office 365 goes right and I it's
something that I've given to

59
00:03:55,080 --> 00:03:57,780
customers in the past when when
I've worked with customers, and

60
00:03:57,780 --> 00:04:00,870
they've said hey, where do I go
for free? Knowledge, where do I

61
00:04:00,870 --> 00:04:03,630
go to learn more about office
365? What training courses can I

62
00:04:03,630 --> 00:04:06,630
go on? I've given them a copy of
the book. And on here you go,

63
00:04:07,110 --> 00:04:10,410
actually hijacked Tony once at
Ignite and made him sign a whole

64
00:04:10,410 --> 00:04:15,030
bunch of USB keys for me. He
wasn't he wasn't pleased. So I

65
00:04:15,030 --> 00:04:19,710
think that that same kind of
methodology is is fantastic.

66
00:04:19,710 --> 00:04:23,160
Because I think one of the
things I've found over the last

67
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:25,590
little while since I've started
doing a lot more security

68
00:04:25,590 --> 00:04:28,860
focused work as well is
sometimes the documentation is

69
00:04:28,860 --> 00:04:32,940
not quite where the where the
product is. And so all I can say

70
00:04:32,940 --> 00:04:35,430
is, you know, hats off, and
congratulations, but it seems

71
00:04:35,430 --> 00:04:39,960
like a mammoth challenge to me
to be kind of taking that on

72
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:44,280
keeping that publishing kind of
cycle going on something that is

73
00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:45,120
that bleeding edge.

74
00:04:45,689 --> 00:04:48,659
Michael Van Horenbeeck: Yeah.
So, I mean, you have no idea how

75
00:04:48,659 --> 00:04:52,139
much effort it goes into the
book. We started writing last

76
00:04:52,139 --> 00:04:55,769
year. And you know, the initial
effort of writing a chapter is

77
00:04:55,769 --> 00:04:58,649
massive, right? But as you're
writing the chapter, they keep

78
00:04:58,649 --> 00:05:01,589
changing stuff, and you're like
finding yourself writing a bit

79
00:05:01,589 --> 00:05:04,319
of bits and pieces and then
rewriting it and then writing

80
00:05:04,319 --> 00:05:06,479
new bits and pieces and
rewriting older stuff that

81
00:05:06,479 --> 00:05:09,959
you've written a couple of weeks
back. So to get to the point

82
00:05:09,959 --> 00:05:12,989
where we're, you know, ready to
release has been a massive

83
00:05:12,989 --> 00:05:16,739
undertaking, but the real
challenge starts now, updating

84
00:05:16,739 --> 00:05:20,009
the book on a monthly basis. If
there's one thing that I've

85
00:05:20,009 --> 00:05:24,569
learned is, don't underestimate
it. I did in the past a little

86
00:05:24,569 --> 00:05:30,299
bit where, you know, sometimes I
didn't account for the time to

87
00:05:30,299 --> 00:05:33,479
write the chapters, right, which
meant that I had to know doing

88
00:05:33,479 --> 00:05:36,479
last minute, which added a lot
of burden. So I learned a lot

89
00:05:36,479 --> 00:05:40,169
from the earlier process. My
respect for Tony for, you know,

90
00:05:40,259 --> 00:05:42,899
keeping the book up to date for
keeping everyone in line and for

91
00:05:42,899 --> 00:05:46,709
doing the copy editing is just
grown tremendously. Because now

92
00:05:46,709 --> 00:05:49,559
I'm taking on that role and I'm
like, Oh, god, what do you do,

93
00:05:49,559 --> 00:05:53,609
you can start with, right? But
at the same time role, so you

94
00:05:53,609 --> 00:05:56,819
know, trying to get to the point
where we want to be that book of

95
00:05:56,819 --> 00:05:59,129
knowledge, right, where we want
to centralize everything, get

96
00:05:59,129 --> 00:06:02,729
that practical guidance. But
it's a journey, right? Even

97
00:06:02,729 --> 00:06:05,909
version one that we're
releasing, we know their stuff

98
00:06:06,089 --> 00:06:10,829
that we should get in there over
time. Like, I'll give you a

99
00:06:10,829 --> 00:06:14,249
practical example Office ATP,
right due to some author

100
00:06:14,249 --> 00:06:16,919
challenges, you know, people
dropping off halfway, because

101
00:06:16,919 --> 00:06:20,549
they, they figured out, hey,
this is too much of a word for

102
00:06:20,549 --> 00:06:24,599
us. We had to cut that chapter
on version one. So we're going

103
00:06:24,599 --> 00:06:28,469
to add that word as part of the
release, you know, in a couple

104
00:06:28,469 --> 00:06:32,999
of months time. But that's a
massive chapter, right? Like our

105
00:06:33,029 --> 00:06:36,869
Defender ATP chapter, even
without practical deployment

106
00:06:36,869 --> 00:06:42,119
guide information is 120 pages
on that one, I'm not gonna call

107
00:06:42,119 --> 00:06:45,389
it a little thing. It's just
it's quickly becoming this huge

108
00:06:45,389 --> 00:06:50,129
mess of stuff. And I think we'll
learn as we go, but it is it is

109
00:06:50,129 --> 00:06:52,649
it is interesting to see at the
very least.

110
00:06:53,099 --> 00:06:55,379
Chris Goosen: Yeah, and I think
the thing is, and we've said it

111
00:06:55,379 --> 00:06:57,389
on the show before it may even
have been on the last episode

112
00:06:57,389 --> 00:06:59,399
where we you know, we call
Microsoft, the security vendor,

113
00:06:59,399 --> 00:07:02,069
right? Because At the end of the
day, that's kind of where they

114
00:07:02,069 --> 00:07:05,009
are right now. And, and a lot of
folks, and I'm seeing this

115
00:07:05,009 --> 00:07:07,499
firsthand with my recent role
change, people don't take

116
00:07:07,499 --> 00:07:11,039
Microsoft seriously in the
security space yet, or at least

117
00:07:11,039 --> 00:07:14,699
a lot of folks don't. But when
you're able to look at something

118
00:07:14,699 --> 00:07:18,599
like this and go, Well, this is
how it all ties together. And

119
00:07:18,749 --> 00:07:21,779
the small thing that's just a,
just a tiny little endpoint

120
00:07:21,779 --> 00:07:25,589
thing is 100 and something pages
worth of documentation. It's

121
00:07:25,589 --> 00:07:28,109
really stunning to say something
and I think it's gonna be a very

122
00:07:28,889 --> 00:07:33,509
easy way to quantify the value
that the platform brings. Right

123
00:07:33,509 --> 00:07:35,519
when you when you when you tie
all these services together.

124
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,250
Michael Van Horenbeeck: Yeah, I
mean, and there is another

125
00:07:38,250 --> 00:07:41,160
interesting tidbit, which you're
just kind of you mentioned

126
00:07:41,190 --> 00:07:44,490
Microsoft cybersecurity vendor,
I'm entirely with you. There's

127
00:07:44,520 --> 00:07:47,250
things they don't do, right.
They don't build firewall. They

128
00:07:47,250 --> 00:07:50,190
do build Azure firewalls, but
don't build physical firewalls

129
00:07:50,190 --> 00:07:55,050
and stuff. But they have a whole
plethora of options and

130
00:07:55,050 --> 00:07:58,020
solutions that somehow tie in
together. They have a vast

131
00:07:58,020 --> 00:08:01,260
ecosystem and it's uncovering
value. system, which is the

132
00:08:01,260 --> 00:08:05,310
interesting part and also the
hard part. But at the same time,

133
00:08:05,310 --> 00:08:08,820
you know, putting everything
together as an author team, we

134
00:08:08,820 --> 00:08:11,700
were already facing the, you
know, where do we put this in

135
00:08:11,700 --> 00:08:17,070
which chapter with this belong?
Or like this feature, it belongs

136
00:08:17,070 --> 00:08:20,520
to product x, but he really
belongs more to this new

137
00:08:20,520 --> 00:08:25,140
paradigm. So where do we put it
into the book? So why expect

138
00:08:25,140 --> 00:08:27,030
that will happen is over the
course of the next couple of

139
00:08:27,030 --> 00:08:29,520
months when, you know, feedback
trickles in when Microsoft, you

140
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:31,950
know, releases new stuff, and
God knows what they've got

141
00:08:31,950 --> 00:08:36,420
planned for this year. You know,
we'll be modifying and updating

142
00:08:36,420 --> 00:08:39,690
the book and that's the beauty
of dating monthly, right? If

143
00:08:39,690 --> 00:08:42,240
something doesn't belong in one
chapter, or we can take it off

144
00:08:42,270 --> 00:08:44,820
next month and put it somewhere
else where it belongs better or

145
00:08:44,820 --> 00:08:48,960
where it feels more natural. But
we see that today, like,

146
00:08:49,020 --> 00:08:51,030
honestly, we've had discussions
about you know, Windows

147
00:08:51,030 --> 00:08:54,360
Information Protection. Well,
you know, do we create a chapter

148
00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:57,660
on Windows 10 security and if
so, well, what about Defender

149
00:08:57,660 --> 00:09:00,960
ATP or attack surface reduction
resource protection? Do we keep

150
00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:03,360
it in Defender ATP? Or do we put
it into Windows? 10 per day?

151
00:09:03,390 --> 00:09:05,430
Yeah, it's kind of like, you
know, ongoing discussions the

152
00:09:05,430 --> 00:09:06,090
entire time.

153
00:09:06,389 --> 00:09:08,369
Chris Goosen: Yeah. And I think
this is probably this probably

154
00:09:08,369 --> 00:09:10,919
is a really good insight into
how meetings within the

155
00:09:10,919 --> 00:09:13,679
Microsoft marketing department
go, right? Because they're

156
00:09:13,679 --> 00:09:16,019
constantly, they're constantly
like they changing the product

157
00:09:16,019 --> 00:09:20,039
names, but also the product name
doesn't always align 100% with

158
00:09:20,129 --> 00:09:24,689
the rest of that, the platform,
so I could definitely see how

159
00:09:24,689 --> 00:09:26,609
that would be a slight, you
know, slight challenge.

160
00:09:27,029 --> 00:09:29,429
Michael Van Horenbeeck: Well,
and you know, it's not just that

161
00:09:30,569 --> 00:09:33,509
Microsoft 365 security for IT
professionals. So you know,

162
00:09:33,539 --> 00:09:37,739
obviously even looks at the 65
side of things. But what we've

163
00:09:37,739 --> 00:09:40,139
already committed to and we
started writing is an Azure

164
00:09:40,139 --> 00:09:44,369
Sentinel chapter now. Better
Sentinel? No, it is and it isn't

165
00:09:44,369 --> 00:09:48,359
entry 65 because it's Azure
workload, but yet we put it

166
00:09:48,359 --> 00:09:51,779
there in the book. So you know,
you can see the cross the bleed

167
00:09:51,779 --> 00:09:54,719
between the two worlds, your
productivity and Azure, which is

168
00:09:54,719 --> 00:09:58,649
typically infrastructure, kind
of converging in becoming one so

169
00:09:58,649 --> 00:10:01,139
you know, maybe we should rename
The book from the get go to

170
00:10:01,139 --> 00:10:03,539
Microsoft Security for IT
professionals editor.

171
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:05,550
Chris Goosen: Now that makes
sense. I mean, I think where

172
00:10:05,550 --> 00:10:09,180
you're at now, I think it, it's
definitely gonna resonate with

173
00:10:09,180 --> 00:10:13,680
the way that it's named. And I
think immediately, when I saw

174
00:10:14,070 --> 00:10:16,140
news about the book it
immediately I was able to put it

175
00:10:16,140 --> 00:10:18,840
together and tie it to, you
know, the other author team and

176
00:10:18,840 --> 00:10:22,290
the work that Tony is doing. And
I think that's really valuable,

177
00:10:22,290 --> 00:10:26,610
because I think not only are is
it going to be a natural

178
00:10:26,610 --> 00:10:30,540
progression for folks who are in
the IT pro space, who are now

179
00:10:31,050 --> 00:10:33,990
possibly becoming more
comfortable with Office 365, and

180
00:10:33,990 --> 00:10:36,810
with the 365 workloads, and now
starting to think a little bit

181
00:10:36,810 --> 00:10:39,180
more security focused. So this
is a natural progression for

182
00:10:39,180 --> 00:10:43,410
them. But this is also a really
good entry point for just pure

183
00:10:43,410 --> 00:10:46,320
infosec folks who have not
played in the micro space

184
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:48,810
before, right. And there are a
lot of people like that there

185
00:10:48,810 --> 00:10:51,660
are a lot of people who come out
out of the Palo Alto, Cisco,

186
00:10:51,900 --> 00:10:55,470
etc. World CrowdStrike world who
have never really dipped their

187
00:10:55,470 --> 00:10:58,230
toe into the Microsoft
ecosystem. I think this is going

188
00:10:58,230 --> 00:11:00,210
to be a really, really good
entry point for them too. Gotta

189
00:11:00,210 --> 00:11:02,280
get involved and see what's
what's actually going on.

190
00:11:02,940 --> 00:11:04,830
Michael Van Horenbeeck: Yeah, so
and that's, that's really

191
00:11:04,830 --> 00:11:07,860
important what you mentioned,
because, as you said, there's a

192
00:11:07,860 --> 00:11:11,310
whole audience that's familiar
with Tony's book, The Office 365

193
00:11:11,310 --> 00:11:13,740
book. And obviously, they, you
know, after having read the

194
00:11:13,740 --> 00:11:16,530
book, you understand the product
really well, the product

195
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:19,170
platform, I should say, really
well, I have certain insights.

196
00:11:19,380 --> 00:11:23,940
So the jump into the entry 65
security is more natural, but

197
00:11:23,970 --> 00:11:27,540
there is a whole, you know, a
whole army of people out there

198
00:11:27,570 --> 00:11:30,180
that you know, are less familiar
with Microsoft products as a

199
00:11:30,180 --> 00:11:33,570
whole, but they're now you know,
faced with new implementations,

200
00:11:33,570 --> 00:11:36,510
new features, you know,
Microsoft everywhere these days.

201
00:11:36,750 --> 00:11:40,080
So what we try and do is, you
know, to keep it accessible,

202
00:11:40,080 --> 00:11:43,680
right, not start up there, but
you start slowly and then build

203
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:47,340
up gradually to the book, which
is also one of the reasons why

204
00:11:47,340 --> 00:11:50,460
the first chapter is not a
really a technical chapter. It's

205
00:11:50,460 --> 00:11:54,120
more you know, okay. So how to
approach it security, because

206
00:11:54,120 --> 00:11:56,160
people come from a security
background, they have this

207
00:11:56,160 --> 00:12:00,510
person in mind if this you know,
thinking like their security It

208
00:12:00,870 --> 00:12:03,000
and someone who's coming from
the productivity side doesn't

209
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:06,240
necessarily have, you kind of
have to blend them together to

210
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:09,570
kind of mix and match the both
worlds which, in itself, we

211
00:12:09,570 --> 00:12:12,450
didn't want to create a 300 page
book about process because

212
00:12:12,450 --> 00:12:14,940
that's though, everyone, you
know, understands why it's

213
00:12:14,940 --> 00:12:17,880
necessary, but it's still dull.
So we kind of slimmed it down to

214
00:12:17,880 --> 00:12:21,300
about 1520 pages to kind of get
everyone in that same mindset,

215
00:12:21,300 --> 00:12:24,960
and then take them on a journey
with identity, Device Management

216
00:12:24,960 --> 00:12:27,120
and support and so on. Okay,
yeah,

217
00:12:27,119 --> 00:12:29,339
Chris Goosen: that makes sense.
I think that's a pretty, pretty

218
00:12:29,339 --> 00:12:31,229
important way to kind of
approach it right. And you kind

219
00:12:31,229 --> 00:12:33,869
of have to have a mix of those
various components. You can't

220
00:12:33,869 --> 00:12:37,769
just be all technical or process
because you end up losing out on

221
00:12:38,009 --> 00:12:40,529
a bunch of, you know, folks lose
out on a bunch of things that

222
00:12:40,529 --> 00:12:43,529
they're looking to learn. But
also, you're not hold at that

223
00:12:43,529 --> 00:12:46,049
point. You're not you know, you
can't be completing a job if you

224
00:12:46,049 --> 00:12:48,509
don't understand, you know, a
little bit of all of those

225
00:12:48,509 --> 00:12:48,989
pieces.

226
00:12:49,439 --> 00:12:51,119
Michael Van Horenbeeck: Mm hmm.
I agree. Yep.

227
00:12:51,750 --> 00:12:53,970
Chris Goosen: Okay, well, look,
Nick, I think Nick might have a

228
00:12:53,970 --> 00:12:54,540
question here.

229
00:12:54,960 --> 00:12:58,890
Nicolas Blank: Yeah. I wanted to
ask Michael, who is the primary

230
00:12:58,890 --> 00:13:01,710
audience for this book is Is
this an operations person who

231
00:13:01,710 --> 00:13:05,370
needs to add security to the
landscape? Or is this for a

232
00:13:05,370 --> 00:13:09,810
hardcore security person who
needs to add Microsoft to their

233
00:13:09,810 --> 00:13:10,440
landscape?

234
00:13:11,759 --> 00:13:13,319
Michael Van Horenbeeck: That's a
good question, Nick. I think

235
00:13:13,319 --> 00:13:20,519
there's value for both right?
This is for the none. Well, tech

236
00:13:20,519 --> 00:13:25,019
savvy but non security savvy, IT
professional that needs to do

237
00:13:25,019 --> 00:13:29,549
something with with something
and security in Microsoft 365. I

238
00:13:29,549 --> 00:13:33,389
mean, we all know how to sale
cycle work, right? Then the

239
00:13:33,419 --> 00:13:36,269
Microsoft sales sales guys there
and tell them hey, it was a

240
00:13:36,269 --> 00:13:38,729
great discount on, you know, the
interesting divide the five

241
00:13:38,729 --> 00:13:40,889
security bundle, and the company
says, Yeah, great, let's do

242
00:13:40,889 --> 00:13:43,589
this. And then, you know, it
rolls downhill to the security

243
00:13:43,589 --> 00:13:46,109
teams or the operational teams
or like lowers first time that

244
00:13:46,109 --> 00:13:49,559
we touch X, Y, or Z. You know,
what can we do with it? How do

245
00:13:49,559 --> 00:13:52,169
we do it? What's the best
practice? What are the caveats,

246
00:13:52,169 --> 00:13:56,189
right? So some of them may have
the actual office 365 experience

247
00:13:56,189 --> 00:13:58,259
and some of them may be coming
from a purely security

248
00:13:58,259 --> 00:14:02,879
perspective, like looking In our
company, and the projects that

249
00:14:02,879 --> 00:14:07,019
we do is we've got exactly that
happening. Like I've got one

250
00:14:07,019 --> 00:14:11,609
project for customers migrating
from McAfee to Defender ATP. And

251
00:14:11,609 --> 00:14:13,979
we're dealing with people that
have dealt with McAfee for

252
00:14:13,979 --> 00:14:17,129
years, they know the product
inside out, they have no

253
00:14:17,129 --> 00:14:20,429
knowledge whatsoever of Defender
ATP. But you know, just looking

254
00:14:20,429 --> 00:14:23,489
at defender by itself, you can't
because it's part of the holder,

255
00:14:23,519 --> 00:14:26,429
your bigger ecosystem. So it
kind of ties in together with

256
00:14:26,429 --> 00:14:29,279
that whole entry. 65 steps are
prevented, super valuable to

257
00:14:29,279 --> 00:14:32,159
have secure resource. But the
same is true. If you're coming

258
00:14:32,159 --> 00:14:34,769
from the other side where, you
know, we've come from exchange

259
00:14:34,769 --> 00:14:38,279
like all of us, all three of us
were hardcore old coal exchange,

260
00:14:38,279 --> 00:14:41,279
guys, we turn a link to
security, you know, a couple of

261
00:14:41,279 --> 00:14:43,889
years back if a book like that
would have existed, I would have

262
00:14:43,889 --> 00:14:47,189
surely appreciate it that rather
than going out and having to

263
00:14:47,189 --> 00:14:48,419
figure out everything on my own,

264
00:14:49,110 --> 00:14:55,020
Nicolas Blank: completely right,
but just like so many other

265
00:14:55,020 --> 00:14:58,770
things in the IT landscape, is
there a process that I can

266
00:14:58,770 --> 00:15:03,570
follow in so Yeah, I'm kind of
picking on from an IT

267
00:15:03,570 --> 00:15:05,850
professional point of view. I
could be ITIL aligned from a

268
00:15:05,850 --> 00:15:10,350
security professional, I could
be mature aligned. How do I

269
00:15:10,380 --> 00:15:12,810
align myself against the
knowledge in the book?

270
00:15:13,200 --> 00:15:15,300
Michael Van Horenbeeck: Yeah,
yeah, I agree. So I understand

271
00:15:15,300 --> 00:15:18,030
what you mean, I'm so this is
where the first chapter clinic

272
00:15:18,030 --> 00:15:22,350
comes in. I mean, there's so
many frameworks out there that

273
00:15:22,350 --> 00:15:26,250
you could use to actually, you
know, build a build a strategy

274
00:15:26,250 --> 00:15:29,370
on what you're going to do.
Personally, I am a NIST

275
00:15:29,370 --> 00:15:32,130
cybersecurity framework fan,
right? With the different

276
00:15:32,130 --> 00:15:35,190
phases, but there's
organizations that adhere to

277
00:15:35,190 --> 00:15:38,640
whole other standards that have
built their own standards, in my

278
00:15:38,640 --> 00:15:41,250
opinion, and you know, maybe
some people will be printed in

279
00:15:41,250 --> 00:15:43,830
what I'm going to say, but, you
know, I don't care which

280
00:15:43,830 --> 00:15:46,650
framework you use, as long as
you use a framework, you have a

281
00:15:46,650 --> 00:15:51,060
plan that works for you. I'm
happy, right? So that's also

282
00:15:51,060 --> 00:15:54,450
what we try to explain that
first chapter. I do mention

283
00:15:54,450 --> 00:15:58,140
meter. And you mentioned ISO, or
you mentioned a PCI DSS or you

284
00:15:58,140 --> 00:16:02,190
mentioned Mississauga security
framework. I explained to the

285
00:16:02,190 --> 00:16:04,350
people in here, these are the
frameworks look at these are the

286
00:16:04,350 --> 00:16:06,750
highlights of these frameworks
now go out and figure out what,

287
00:16:06,960 --> 00:16:09,750
what's important to you.
Obviously, if you're a financial

288
00:16:09,750 --> 00:16:14,850
institution, PCI DSS will come
up really quickly. And even

289
00:16:14,850 --> 00:16:18,300
there, we try and give some
practical examples. Like there's

290
00:16:18,300 --> 00:16:21,000
this huge mapping sheet between
all the different frameworks

291
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,070
that tells you you have the
controls in this framework equal

292
00:16:23,070 --> 00:16:26,820
the controls in that framework.
So we refer to that to that

293
00:16:26,940 --> 00:16:29,490
sheet to tell them you know, if
you're already compliant with

294
00:16:29,490 --> 00:16:32,040
this, but you want to look at
the other one, just use that

295
00:16:32,040 --> 00:16:36,000
cheat, do the mapping so that
you don't do the work twice. But

296
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,730
at the same time, we don't want
this to become a book on how to

297
00:16:38,730 --> 00:16:41,070
use the frameworks. There's
plenty of books out there that

298
00:16:41,070 --> 00:16:44,460
explain these frameworks into
details. You could go on

299
00:16:45,330 --> 00:16:49,830
certification on once one
framework itself. So we wanted

300
00:16:49,830 --> 00:16:52,290
to explain why they're there and
where it's important, but we

301
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:55,500
didn't want to go into the
detail of, you know, this is how

302
00:16:55,500 --> 00:16:56,490
each of them work.

303
00:16:57,390 --> 00:16:59,310
Chris Goosen: I think that seems
that sounds like a really,

304
00:16:59,310 --> 00:17:03,090
really good approach. Honestly,
and I, I, for one can't actually

305
00:17:03,090 --> 00:17:05,880
wait to get my hands on this so
that I could actually have a

306
00:17:05,910 --> 00:17:07,950
have a look at that, because I
think that's definitely

307
00:17:07,950 --> 00:17:11,550
something that I've found
particularly challenging kind of

308
00:17:11,550 --> 00:17:14,970
entering into this this world is
is the fact that everyone has a

309
00:17:14,970 --> 00:17:17,220
framework that they look up to,
and that is super important to

310
00:17:17,220 --> 00:17:21,240
them. But the relationship
between them, and then I think

311
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:24,390
it's that's a super important
kind of introductory step for

312
00:17:24,390 --> 00:17:24,780
sure.

313
00:17:25,860 --> 00:17:27,750
Michael Van Horenbeeck: I agree.
Yeah. facing the same

314
00:17:27,750 --> 00:17:32,340
challenges, right for moving
into ISO certification 28 27,001

315
00:17:32,340 --> 00:17:35,730
for our own company. Oh, my
gosh, it's like there's a whole

316
00:17:35,730 --> 00:17:38,880
avalanche of stuff coming to
you. And you're like, Really? So

317
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:42,570
yeah, no, it's getting trying to
be practical. I think there's,

318
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:45,330
we could write 100 pages about
one of the things but we

319
00:17:45,420 --> 00:17:48,870
deliberately kept it, you know,
short and sweet, I'd say.

320
00:17:49,320 --> 00:17:51,480
Chris Goosen: Yeah, I think that
it sounds like it. Right. And so

321
00:17:51,480 --> 00:17:56,340
the question I had for you was,
I mean, this so much as far as

322
00:17:56,340 --> 00:17:59,490
security functionality goes
within within the service,

323
00:17:59,490 --> 00:18:03,150
right? But I think there's a lot
of organizations that still have

324
00:18:03,150 --> 00:18:07,380
this mentality that we've given
out, we give Microsoft up

325
00:18:07,560 --> 00:18:10,740
monthly subscription money, and
we've put our data in their

326
00:18:10,740 --> 00:18:14,520
service. Why do we have to worry
about the security functionality

327
00:18:14,520 --> 00:18:16,890
of this? Right? Shouldn't
Microsoft be taking care of all

328
00:18:16,890 --> 00:18:19,020
of the security functionality
for us? Why are we having to

329
00:18:19,020 --> 00:18:22,320
care about this? I mean, are you
coming across that in Europe as

330
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:24,690
well? Is that something that
you've seen?

331
00:18:25,740 --> 00:18:28,320
Michael Van Horenbeeck: Yeah, I
mean, less than less, to be

332
00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:30,720
honest, because people are
getting more and more used to

333
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:32,970
the cloud model where, you know,
there was a segregation of

334
00:18:32,970 --> 00:18:35,670
duties, where, you know,
infrastructure, sure, that's

335
00:18:35,670 --> 00:18:38,940
Microsoft Word, like physical
security. Sure, let them take

336
00:18:38,940 --> 00:18:42,390
care of that. But you know, the
layer that you build on top of

337
00:18:42,390 --> 00:18:44,880
that solutions that you build on
top of that, you know, people

338
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:48,060
are starting to understand that
that's your responsibility. Now,

339
00:18:48,060 --> 00:18:51,450
there's still a whole long way
to go. There are still a lot of

340
00:18:51,450 --> 00:18:54,810
companies that try and get
around why do we need x y, z.

341
00:18:55,170 --> 00:18:59,940
But you know, the reality is is
that whenever you see today,

342
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:03,900
These days in the news, there is
breaches you're far and few in

343
00:19:03,900 --> 00:19:06,630
between. Every day there is a
breach. There's a leak or

344
00:19:06,630 --> 00:19:09,840
something. I think, you know,
gradually people will

345
00:19:09,840 --> 00:19:12,510
understand. Alright, we need to
do this. Like, you need to lock

346
00:19:12,510 --> 00:19:16,320
your door a couple of hundred
years back, no one locked your

347
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:19,500
doors. There were no locks.
Right? The doors are open. Well,

348
00:19:19,530 --> 00:19:23,190
today go out and find a house
where there's no lock. Hmm.

349
00:19:23,640 --> 00:19:25,770
Yeah, I think it's pretty much
the same.

350
00:19:26,219 --> 00:19:29,309
Chris Goosen: Yeah, I think that
that makes sense. I think enable

351
00:19:29,309 --> 00:19:32,849
multi factor everyone if you
haven't done it MFA. It's just

352
00:19:32,849 --> 00:19:36,479
my, my, my PSA for the day. I
you know, we got to make sure to

353
00:19:36,479 --> 00:19:38,999
pull that out in every episode,
just because it's such an

354
00:19:38,999 --> 00:19:42,569
important thing. You know, we
see, I although I think the last

355
00:19:42,569 --> 00:19:46,469
couple of weeks have been very
much taken up by f5. And their

356
00:19:46,799 --> 00:19:49,349
vulnerability that everyone
seems to be bypassing or

357
00:19:49,349 --> 00:19:53,099
whatever, but definitely a lot
of the things that we're seeing

358
00:19:54,059 --> 00:19:57,239
could easily be have been
mitigated by just MFA, right?

359
00:19:57,269 --> 00:20:01,379
But companies I think are just
folks are not being educated and

360
00:20:01,379 --> 00:20:04,439
and they're not kind of taking
that active decision to, to go,

361
00:20:04,439 --> 00:20:06,659
hey, let's see how we can
continually improve this. This

362
00:20:06,659 --> 00:20:10,349
is not the cloud is not set and
forget, right? It doesn't matter

363
00:20:10,349 --> 00:20:13,259
what any vendor tells you, you
can't just go and throw your

364
00:20:13,259 --> 00:20:17,099
data at a service, pay them and
forget about it. Like there has

365
00:20:17,099 --> 00:20:19,349
to be a continuous improvement
model that, you know, you're

366
00:20:19,349 --> 00:20:21,929
going to be looking at where the
threats can come from, because

367
00:20:22,229 --> 00:20:24,599
at the end of the day, the bad
actors continue to evolve as

368
00:20:24,599 --> 00:20:28,169
well. Right? And you can't, you
can't just go Okay, well, this

369
00:20:28,169 --> 00:20:30,299
is the assumed knowledge
everyone has, and we're gonna

370
00:20:30,299 --> 00:20:32,519
we're safe. Yeah, you might be
safe today. That doesn't mean

371
00:20:32,519 --> 00:20:35,219
you're safe tomorrow. Right? So
I think that this whole thing

372
00:20:35,219 --> 00:20:40,949
with f5 is really kind of shown.
A lot of folks that are, you

373
00:20:40,949 --> 00:20:43,439
know, a lot of organizations
that are slower to move to the

374
00:20:43,439 --> 00:20:47,789
cloud and stay or staying on
prem, because security right are

375
00:20:47,789 --> 00:20:52,799
now the ones that are targeted
by this, you know, this thing in

376
00:20:52,799 --> 00:20:55,229
their security, like their,
their legacy infrastructure, if

377
00:20:55,229 --> 00:20:57,779
you will, right. So this is a
very, very interesting thing to

378
00:20:57,779 --> 00:20:58,919
be kind of paying attention to

379
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,470
Michael Van Horenbeeck: We
mentioned it in the book, a

380
00:21:01,470 --> 00:21:04,740
little spoiler there, but it's
about 68% of all breaches in the

381
00:21:04,740 --> 00:21:10,320
cloud originate on premises like
68%. Yes, that's, that's a large

382
00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:13,950
number. And again, you know,
attackers are people with

383
00:21:14,100 --> 00:21:17,100
intent. They'll always take the
path of least resistance. If

384
00:21:17,100 --> 00:21:19,320
it's easier to get into your
cloud through your on prem

385
00:21:19,320 --> 00:21:22,950
environment, they'll do that,
right? And this is just true. I

386
00:21:22,950 --> 00:21:26,700
mean, when a pen test happens,
you should know, right? kudelski

387
00:21:26,700 --> 00:21:31,230
does these tests, right?
Whenever a pen test happens, I

388
00:21:31,290 --> 00:21:34,920
rarely seen them go after Azure.
At first, they're like, Okay,

389
00:21:34,920 --> 00:21:37,980
let's try and get into the
device. And we're into Active

390
00:21:37,980 --> 00:21:40,380
Directory, then some letter
Academy movement, and bam, we've

391
00:21:40,380 --> 00:21:43,260
got your domain. And then from
there, it's easy to get back

392
00:21:43,290 --> 00:21:46,170
back up into the cloud. You
know, that's where the

393
00:21:46,170 --> 00:21:49,230
challenges lie. So the people
that are full traditionally on

394
00:21:49,230 --> 00:21:52,680
premises, they have a lot of
work to be done there a lot more

395
00:21:52,710 --> 00:21:55,920
than, you know, lowering your
attack surface in the cloud, but

396
00:21:55,920 --> 00:21:58,620
at the same time, it's very
different, right, the things

397
00:21:58,620 --> 00:22:01,230
that you have to deal with on
premises No, they're not the

398
00:22:01,230 --> 00:22:05,970
same as in the cloud, which is
also one of the messages that

399
00:22:05,970 --> 00:22:09,660
we're trying to get across is
like, it is changing sure

400
00:22:09,660 --> 00:22:13,440
devices device, that doesn't
change. But you know, Cloud

401
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:17,070
Platform cloud applications,
they operate in a very different

402
00:22:17,070 --> 00:22:20,280
way. The your security is a very
different way and therefore have

403
00:22:20,280 --> 00:22:22,800
different security measures or
how to approach that.

404
00:22:24,030 --> 00:22:27,180
Chris Goosen: Yeah, and I mean,
even getting down to managing

405
00:22:27,180 --> 00:22:28,920
those that infrastructure,
right, the way that you

406
00:22:28,920 --> 00:22:31,500
typically would do that on
premises versus the way that

407
00:22:31,500 --> 00:22:34,860
you're possibly doing it today,
it's very different in the way

408
00:22:34,860 --> 00:22:37,890
you approach it. So it's kind of
like I think the message really

409
00:22:37,890 --> 00:22:41,400
is that you have to be able to
adapt to the way that you know,

410
00:22:41,460 --> 00:22:44,010
the new modern way of doing
things and you can't be stuck in

411
00:22:44,010 --> 00:22:46,260
the old world for too long,
right. Otherwise, you're gonna

412
00:22:47,040 --> 00:22:51,330
you're gonna lag behind. So
yeah, that's so. So we've

413
00:22:51,330 --> 00:22:54,690
talked, we've talked a lot about
the book and honestly, I

414
00:22:54,810 --> 00:22:57,330
personally can't wait to get my
hands on a copy here. Can you

415
00:22:57,330 --> 00:23:02,070
give us some information about
where when how all of that?

416
00:23:02,550 --> 00:23:06,000
Michael Van Horenbeeck: Sure. So
not sure when the podcast is

417
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:09,900
going to be released. But our
target is to release July 13.

418
00:23:10,380 --> 00:23:13,680
I've got a full weekend of copy
editing, building the book and

419
00:23:13,680 --> 00:23:17,490
you're getting the PDF ready.
We've got the website up. So the

420
00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:21,630
entry 65 security book comm
where you can get to the book

421
00:23:21,630 --> 00:23:23,940
files are actually to the
government platform through

422
00:23:23,940 --> 00:23:26,940
which we're selling the book,
which is the same platform as

423
00:23:26,940 --> 00:23:32,790
the office 365 for IT pros book.
So money 13th the book will be

424
00:23:32,790 --> 00:23:35,760
available, obviously, it will
make a big splash on LinkedIn,

425
00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:39,030
Twitter, the website itself,
we'll make it known and then

426
00:23:39,030 --> 00:23:42,150
hopefully people will find their
way to the book itself as well.

427
00:23:42,540 --> 00:23:44,130
Chris Goosen: Okay, and would
you are you gonna be releasing

428
00:23:44,130 --> 00:23:45,150
on Amazon as well? Oh,

429
00:23:45,930 --> 00:23:48,480
Michael Van Horenbeeck: no,
that's a deliberate choice we

430
00:23:48,510 --> 00:23:52,440
we've made and actually I'm
leaning on Tony's experience of

431
00:23:52,440 --> 00:23:55,380
building the book for Amazon.
There's a couple of things like

432
00:23:55,410 --> 00:23:58,920
the the amount of effort going
into building that book or the E

433
00:23:58,920 --> 00:24:01,560
pub and making sure that In
Amazon, that's one thing.

434
00:24:01,890 --> 00:24:05,760
Secondly, Amazon doesn't support
monthly updates. gumroad is

435
00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:08,970
easy, because it's just changing
the PDF like first one to

436
00:24:08,970 --> 00:24:12,000
version two and off you go.
Right, nothing else changes. And

437
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:16,830
because of that, I didn't want
to take on more work. Plus, you

438
00:24:16,830 --> 00:24:19,530
know, supporting the authors
supporting the marketing, the

439
00:24:19,530 --> 00:24:23,490
hosting everything for the book
cost money. Amazon, you know,

440
00:24:23,520 --> 00:24:27,600
takes a 70% cut on the book.
Wow. Which, you know, it's great

441
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:30,720
because you reach a bigger
audience. But at the end of the

442
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:33,780
day, I just think that the
effort you put into it, and the

443
00:24:33,780 --> 00:24:35,910
gains that you get from it, and
the gains that people get from

444
00:24:35,910 --> 00:24:40,020
it, are too liberal to justify
using Amazon as a platform.

445
00:24:40,470 --> 00:24:42,690
Chris Goosen: I think that makes
sense. I mean, personally, I've,

446
00:24:42,870 --> 00:24:44,970
I've always used the, the
gumroad platform because I

447
00:24:44,970 --> 00:24:48,060
prefer just having the PDF copy
of the book, right. It's more

448
00:24:48,060 --> 00:24:50,640
portable for me. I know others
disagree with that, because I

449
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:53,940
want to use Kindle and whatnot.
I you know, it's not my

450
00:24:53,970 --> 00:24:57,690
preferred method of reading. So,
you know, it is what it is. But

451
00:24:58,080 --> 00:25:00,090
yeah, mix. I think that makes
sense. And I think it's good

452
00:25:00,120 --> 00:25:02,430
Good to get the message out
there to folks like this one

453
00:25:02,430 --> 00:25:05,340
platform. That's where you can
go and get it. And that's also

454
00:25:05,340 --> 00:25:07,650
where you get your your updates,
right? Because that reminds me

455
00:25:07,650 --> 00:25:10,740
how the subscription model works
again. So you, you buy an

456
00:25:10,740 --> 00:25:13,800
edition of the book and you get
all updates that are part of

457
00:25:13,800 --> 00:25:14,730
that edition, correct?

458
00:25:14,790 --> 00:25:16,620
Michael Van Horenbeeck: Yes,
Yes, correct. So there is a

459
00:25:16,620 --> 00:25:20,040
yearly cycle. We're starting
July of this year, which is

460
00:25:20,040 --> 00:25:24,810
coincidentally called the 2026
or 20 2006 edition. But anyway,

461
00:25:25,080 --> 00:25:29,100
so the 2020 edition runs up
until June of next year, you buy

462
00:25:29,100 --> 00:25:31,920
the book, you get all the
updates that year and you know,

463
00:25:32,160 --> 00:25:35,430
we are committing not just to
updates of the chapters, but

464
00:25:35,460 --> 00:25:39,510
this year we'll also committed
to a practical guidance chapter

465
00:25:39,510 --> 00:25:42,690
on the ATP on an Azure Sentinel
chapter and Office ATP chapter.

466
00:25:43,020 --> 00:25:47,160
So with the book, you know,
you'll be getting that. And then

467
00:25:47,190 --> 00:25:50,520
up until June, you'll get
updates sometime next year,

468
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:55,080
March ish timeframe, will start
thinking or building the new

469
00:25:55,080 --> 00:25:59,280
book, which means new edition
2021 edition. We may you know,

470
00:25:59,340 --> 00:26:02,790
do completely overhaul we may
add more chapters into that

471
00:26:03,030 --> 00:26:05,160
really depends on Oh, ever
everything, you know, moves

472
00:26:05,160 --> 00:26:09,210
along. I mean, we all know that
Microsoft is doing shifting in

473
00:26:09,210 --> 00:26:14,190
that space as well with the
acquisition of cyber x in the OT

474
00:26:14,190 --> 00:26:17,640
space. So we're closely
monitoring that. And then based

475
00:26:17,640 --> 00:26:21,180
on that, we'll build a new book,
new edition, and from there on,

476
00:26:21,330 --> 00:26:23,880
people who have bought the first
book and can get the new one at

477
00:26:23,880 --> 00:26:28,680
a discount, you know, kind of
your appreciate their, your,

478
00:26:28,710 --> 00:26:31,620
their loyalty to the book, and
then they get updates for a year

479
00:26:31,620 --> 00:26:33,990
as well. So there is no monthly
fee, it's just a one off and

480
00:26:33,990 --> 00:26:35,580
then you'll get the updates per
year.

481
00:26:36,360 --> 00:26:38,220
Chris Goosen: Yeah, fantastic.
And I think what's what's great

482
00:26:38,220 --> 00:26:40,710
about that, and certainly, you
know, the way that I've

483
00:26:40,770 --> 00:26:45,570
approached this with with the
the other book is that the book

484
00:26:45,570 --> 00:26:50,040
is so large now, it's gotten so
big that it's it's a fantastic

485
00:26:50,040 --> 00:26:54,450
reference. And realistically, I
you know, I don't read through

486
00:26:54,450 --> 00:26:57,210
the whole thing every time I get
it. Now, I just like I read the

487
00:26:57,210 --> 00:26:59,910
new chapters when I get the new
chapters, but I know I have this

488
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:03,540
In a referenceable thing in my
in my tool bag, if you will,

489
00:27:03,540 --> 00:27:06,270
right where I can rip it out.
And, you know, remember back in

490
00:27:06,270 --> 00:27:10,500
the day when we had the exchange
administrators pocket to get to

491
00:27:10,500 --> 00:27:12,180
guide it's something like that.

492
00:27:12,810 --> 00:27:14,880
Michael Van Horenbeeck: Yeah,
well at the same time though I'm

493
00:27:15,300 --> 00:27:18,900
really keen on making sure we
don't bloat the book because

494
00:27:18,900 --> 00:27:21,720
it's so easy to go over, you
know a certain amount of pages.

495
00:27:22,080 --> 00:27:27,330
Right now we're not it's five
600 pages, which is sizable by

496
00:27:27,330 --> 00:27:31,440
itself. But once you go over
that, like it becomes that huge

497
00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:36,000
chunk and people start not
reading certain chapters or they

498
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:39,030
start being selective which is
which is fine, right, but I

499
00:27:39,030 --> 00:27:42,750
really want to keep it you know,
concise so that it is

500
00:27:42,750 --> 00:27:47,340
digestible. You know, obviously
some things just take like the

501
00:27:47,340 --> 00:27:49,950
unwritten so many pages, we have
them Defender ATP, it's just

502
00:27:49,950 --> 00:27:53,520
because we need that much,
right. We honestly we couldn't

503
00:27:53,520 --> 00:27:56,580
have done it with less maybe we
could have done 90 pages and you

504
00:27:56,580 --> 00:27:58,590
know, cut some redundancy here
and there but at the end of the

505
00:27:58,590 --> 00:28:04,230
day, you need what you need. My
goal is to keep it sizable, but

506
00:28:04,230 --> 00:28:07,140
you will see, you know, talk to
me in a year and maybe I'll be

507
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:08,280
six 700 pages.

508
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:10,940
Chris Goosen: Yeah, no. I mean,
look, I fair enough. And I think

509
00:28:10,940 --> 00:28:15,380
the thing is, given your
experience in the industry, and

510
00:28:15,380 --> 00:28:19,310
given your experience learning
things, I think you have a

511
00:28:19,310 --> 00:28:22,670
fairly good idea of what it
takes to be able to get that

512
00:28:22,670 --> 00:28:25,310
message out there in a way that
is going to be useful to someone

513
00:28:25,520 --> 00:28:30,350
without it being too bloated or
to kind of, you know, too wordy,

514
00:28:30,830 --> 00:28:33,650
but also, you know, where it's
sometimes where it's just not

515
00:28:33,650 --> 00:28:37,100
enough, right? Unfortunately,
the internet is full of blog

516
00:28:37,100 --> 00:28:41,420
posts that tackle a particular
topic, but really just scratch

517
00:28:41,450 --> 00:28:43,700
not even scratch the surface.
Basically, they just kind of

518
00:28:43,700 --> 00:28:46,250
give you a little bit of
interest. You know, and you need

519
00:28:46,250 --> 00:28:50,030
to like to everyone who has
blogs credit, that's great. But

520
00:28:50,060 --> 00:28:52,880
but sometimes sometimes you need
to dig one level deeper. Right?

521
00:28:52,880 --> 00:28:57,080
And I think the what's great
about that your history with

522
00:28:57,530 --> 00:29:01,220
with the other book, also you
Your history as a, you know,

523
00:29:01,220 --> 00:29:03,620
blog author and speaker and
stuff is I think that you have

524
00:29:03,620 --> 00:29:06,470
that balance, you know how to
find that balance. And so yeah,

525
00:29:06,470 --> 00:29:08,150
really looking forward to what
you and the team have kind of

526
00:29:08,150 --> 00:29:11,690
come up with here. I can't wait
to get get my hands on a copy,

527
00:29:12,110 --> 00:29:14,960
Michael Van Horenbeeck: you'll
get a copy from me, but only as

528
00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:17,270
you get feedback, because this
is, you know, one of the

529
00:29:17,270 --> 00:29:20,840
messages that we're going to
push really hard. Um, that to

530
00:29:20,840 --> 00:29:23,750
me, that book is a collaborative
effort, right? Yes, the author

531
00:29:23,750 --> 00:29:27,050
team has written something, but
we can only improve, make it

532
00:29:27,050 --> 00:29:30,950
better and make it you know,
more suitable if people use the

533
00:29:30,950 --> 00:29:34,340
feedback, right? If they email
us and tell us we like it, or

534
00:29:34,370 --> 00:29:37,400
Hey, you know, we're missing
this piece, so that we know

535
00:29:37,400 --> 00:29:39,380
maybe we haven't thought about
it. Or maybe we didn't

536
00:29:39,380 --> 00:29:43,040
prioritize it in the same way
that people are asking for. Call

537
00:29:43,040 --> 00:29:46,430
it a user voice. If 100 people
email us and tell us we really

538
00:29:46,430 --> 00:29:51,140
need this piece of information.
And we as authors, we didn't

539
00:29:51,140 --> 00:29:54,050
prioritize it as high, we might
just shift it up in priority and

540
00:29:54,050 --> 00:29:55,970
just add it into the book
because there was too long for

541
00:29:55,970 --> 00:29:59,390
it, right? So I'm really keen to
see how that's gonna work. I

542
00:29:59,390 --> 00:30:02,750
know that too. He's getting tons
of feedback through his feedback

543
00:30:02,750 --> 00:30:05,720
channels on the book, you know,
even to correct things as wrong

544
00:30:05,720 --> 00:30:09,320
because you never want to make
mistakes. Because I'm like our

545
00:30:09,350 --> 00:30:14,000
tech tech reviewer, he's done an
amazing job. But you know, he's

546
00:30:14,030 --> 00:30:16,640
going haywire through all the
chapters, all the events that

547
00:30:16,640 --> 00:30:19,040
we're firing at him all the
things that he needs to test. I

548
00:30:19,040 --> 00:30:23,000
mean, we're doing our best to
make sure that it's you know,

549
00:30:23,030 --> 00:30:27,800
without any spelling errors,
grammar spelling, even me as a

550
00:30:27,800 --> 00:30:31,190
copy editor. I'm not even native
English speaker. So, you know,

551
00:30:31,280 --> 00:30:33,680
things will slip but we'll,
we're counting on that.

552
00:30:33,900 --> 00:30:35,460
Chris Goosen: And I was actually
just going to touch on that

553
00:30:35,460 --> 00:30:40,950
point, right is I'm always
amazed by the fact that and I've

554
00:30:40,950 --> 00:30:43,380
read some of your works before
where I've, you know, we've done

555
00:30:43,380 --> 00:30:46,620
I've done you know, we've done
work for the same vendor writing

556
00:30:46,620 --> 00:30:48,330
vendor or whatever, and we've
kind of reviewed each other's

557
00:30:48,330 --> 00:30:52,200
stuff and I I'm always amazed
that as someone who's not even

558
00:30:52,290 --> 00:30:56,430
an English first language
speaker, the level at which you

559
00:30:56,430 --> 00:31:00,000
managed to crank out this this
awesome work, right so you know,

560
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:02,610
Kudos to that. And I think this
is something that everyone needs

561
00:31:02,610 --> 00:31:05,880
to also understand is that the
team and correct me if I'm

562
00:31:05,880 --> 00:31:08,730
wrong, and I actually like you
to introduce the team that you

563
00:31:08,730 --> 00:31:10,350
know, that you're working with,
because I actually don't know

564
00:31:10,350 --> 00:31:13,650
everyone personally, like, I
know you. But you guys are all

565
00:31:13,650 --> 00:31:14,550
based in Europe, right?

566
00:31:15,150 --> 00:31:17,520
Michael Van Horenbeeck: No, no,
not really. So we've got a mic

567
00:31:17,790 --> 00:31:21,720
on it, or both also, in VPS, do
a lot of work in the security

568
00:31:21,720 --> 00:31:27,300
space. They're based out of the
United United Arab Emirates.

569
00:31:28,350 --> 00:31:33,570
There are actually I think I'm
our move to Dubai right now. So

570
00:31:33,570 --> 00:31:36,180
they're based out of there. I've
got a couple of folks in the

571
00:31:36,180 --> 00:31:40,440
Netherlands. I've got as you can
see, lovely works for me, as

572
00:31:40,440 --> 00:31:44,070
well. And, you know, it just so
happened that when I started

573
00:31:44,070 --> 00:31:46,530
reaching out to folks that they
were the first to respond and

574
00:31:46,530 --> 00:31:51,870
said, Yeah, sure. We want to do
that. But yeah, it's been it's

575
00:31:51,870 --> 00:31:55,050
been helpful because, you know,
less timezone issues. It's only

576
00:31:55,050 --> 00:31:58,470
a couple of hours apart. But
we'll we'll see. I mean,

577
00:31:59,070 --> 00:32:03,060
reaching out to the For the
Office ATP chapter, I think we

578
00:32:03,060 --> 00:32:07,230
might actually cross jump over
to to the US to onboard someone

579
00:32:07,230 --> 00:32:11,670
else. But as far as the team
goes, so we've got alarm on a

580
00:32:11,670 --> 00:32:15,780
tour doing the NBA TV chapter,
we've got Peter who's doing

581
00:32:15,810 --> 00:32:19,440
Intune and identity. We've got
Thomas was focusing on

582
00:32:20,160 --> 00:32:23,430
information protection, which,
you know, coincidentally you

583
00:32:23,430 --> 00:32:26,580
could say it is more compliance
feature rather than security

584
00:32:26,580 --> 00:32:30,870
feature, but as you said, to
kind of blogs to it. Next to

585
00:32:30,870 --> 00:32:33,690
building the book in the the
copy editing, I'm doing em Kaz

586
00:32:33,900 --> 00:32:36,090
during the introduction, and
also doing some work here and

587
00:32:36,090 --> 00:32:39,570
there and the other chapters,
and then task is doing the all

588
00:32:39,600 --> 00:32:40,470
all up review.

589
00:32:40,920 --> 00:32:43,740
Chris Goosen: Okay. And I think
what's great about having, like

590
00:32:43,740 --> 00:32:46,020
an international team like that
is everyone has their

591
00:32:46,290 --> 00:32:48,360
potentially slightly different
market. So there's going to be

592
00:32:48,360 --> 00:32:50,880
slightly different point of view
and slightly different

593
00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:53,430
experience coming into it and
blending it all together. I

594
00:32:53,430 --> 00:32:54,840
think that's really powerful
too.

595
00:32:55,440 --> 00:32:58,560
Michael Van Horenbeeck: It's
incredibly useful, like in the

596
00:32:58,560 --> 00:33:01,080
talks that we've had, that is
questions that we've had. I've

597
00:33:01,080 --> 00:33:04,530
learned so much like, insights
from from Amar in certain things

598
00:33:04,530 --> 00:33:07,500
and how to approach it even you
marketing the book, but also

599
00:33:07,650 --> 00:33:11,070
structuring the book. We've had
another meeting last week, where

600
00:33:11,070 --> 00:33:14,460
we were just talking, like
brainstorming, all of a sudden

601
00:33:14,460 --> 00:33:17,310
everyone was like, Yeah, wow,
that's a great idea, just by

602
00:33:17,340 --> 00:33:19,560
having that interaction. And
that's, you know, it's a

603
00:33:19,560 --> 00:33:22,590
learning process for each and
every one of us. And, you know,

604
00:33:22,590 --> 00:33:24,450
it's fun. So, yeah,

605
00:33:25,080 --> 00:33:28,440
Chris Goosen: well, that's super
exciting. Honestly, I think I

606
00:33:28,440 --> 00:33:32,220
can't I can't wait. Like I said,
and it's really the timing on

607
00:33:32,220 --> 00:33:33,900
this is absolutely perfect. Like
you couldn't have picked a

608
00:33:33,900 --> 00:33:37,770
better you know, a better time
for it. So I think with that, I

609
00:33:37,770 --> 00:33:41,340
mean, just kind of keeping
keeping an eye on the on the

610
00:33:41,340 --> 00:33:43,620
clock here. I know. We've all
got other things to get to.

611
00:33:44,160 --> 00:33:46,500
Nick. I just wanted to just to
check in that. You're still

612
00:33:46,500 --> 00:33:51,240
breathing, buddy. I I'm sorry.
I've taken over.

613
00:33:53,550 --> 00:33:55,860
Nicolas Blank: If the questions
weren't so good. I throw in some

614
00:33:55,860 --> 00:33:56,790
more but you're doing great.

615
00:33:58,410 --> 00:34:01,530
Chris Goosen: Michael before we
let you go As we always kind of

616
00:34:01,530 --> 00:34:04,200
do when we when we kind of, you
know, tie off the end of the

617
00:34:04,200 --> 00:34:08,550
show. How do you want to be
found can obviously be great if

618
00:34:08,550 --> 00:34:11,700
you want to develop the URL for
the book again, how do people

619
00:34:11,700 --> 00:34:14,430
find you on social media if you
want to be found, but I know you

620
00:34:14,430 --> 00:34:18,990
have a fairly fairly active
social profile so go ahead,

621
00:34:19,530 --> 00:34:20,970
Michael Van Horenbeeck: not as
active as I used to be just

622
00:34:20,970 --> 00:34:25,260
because I'm writing the book. So
but you know, on Twitter I am

623
00:34:25,260 --> 00:34:28,050
and then hybrid, I think that's
the easiest way to get a hold of

624
00:34:28,050 --> 00:34:31,290
me because my last name, you
don't even try to pronounce it

625
00:34:31,290 --> 00:34:35,310
in English. So advanta hybrid.
From there, you've got the URL,

626
00:34:35,310 --> 00:34:37,560
you'll have the book title,
you'll see my blog post.

627
00:34:37,830 --> 00:34:41,100
Obviously, I'm on LinkedIn as
well but has my full back name

628
00:34:41,130 --> 00:34:45,300
and Vanderbeek. But through
Twitter, you'll easily find me

629
00:34:45,300 --> 00:34:49,290
I've got my own blog at the vet
hybrid calm so you can get to

630
00:34:49,290 --> 00:34:54,630
there or the book of website
m365securitybook.com as well,

631
00:34:54,630 --> 00:34:57,600
but I'll share it with you so
that you can post it with the

632
00:34:57,630 --> 00:34:58,590
recording as well.

633
00:34:58,800 --> 00:35:00,420
Chris Goosen: Yeah, thank you. I
think we'll We'll definitely

634
00:35:00,420 --> 00:35:03,180
make sure to put all of these in
the in the show notes for the

635
00:35:03,510 --> 00:35:05,700

we can kind of get that out

636
00:35:05,700 --> 00:35:09,030
there. But thanks again for for
taking the time to speak to us.

637

announcement, I guess. And we're

in Europe, but I'm sure you

00:35:17,100 --> 00:35:19,080
still got a few things to get on
with for the day. So

641
00:35:20,070 --> 00:35:22,200

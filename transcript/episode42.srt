Warren du Toit: Hello, everyone,
and welcome to another episode

11
00:00:56,590 --> 00:01:01,120
of the cloud architects. We have
to really cool guests with us

12
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:02,650
today from ignite

13
00:01:03,240 --> 00:01:04,320
Rick Claus: cloud architects.

14
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,330
Warren du Toit: Yeah, yeah,
cloud architects. Patch and

15
00:01:07,330 --> 00:01:08,650
switch, welcome to the show.

16
00:01:10,790 --> 00:01:11,450

00:01:13,770 --> 00:01:14,520
Joey Snow: Sure.

19
00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:17,730
Nicolas Blank: Or legendary at
least if you prefer

20
00:01:19,140 --> 00:01:20,160
Joey Snow: dairy probably

21
00:01:20,190 --> 00:01:23,010
Nicolas Blank: dairy, dairy. Is
this an allergy show?

22
00:01:24,390 --> 00:01:25,290
Joey Snow: allergy free zone?

23
00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:27,150
Warren du Toit: allergy free
lactose free.

24
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:30,930
Nicolas Blank: Safe Zone and too
I had

25
00:01:30,870 --> 00:01:33,270
Rick Claus: my almond milk latte
earlier today. I'm all set.

26
00:01:33,270 --> 00:01:34,740
Joey Snow: Oh, nice. Nice.

27
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:37,350
Warren du Toit: That's
fantastic. And how's your week

28
00:01:37,350 --> 00:01:37,530
been?

29
00:01:38,670 --> 00:01:41,700
Joey Snow: It's been busy but
it's been fantastic. getting a

30
00:01:41,700 --> 00:01:46,230
chance to see everyone see the
community the MVPs the our

31
00:01:46,290 --> 00:01:50,520
customers I still have meetings
left to do Really? Wow. I've

32
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:54,120
dinner tonight with corporate
partners that I managed so yeah,

33
00:01:54,150 --> 00:01:55,530
it's it's it's been busy.

34
00:01:55,740 --> 00:01:58,110
Rick Claus: It's been kind of
crazy having a maintain your day

35
00:01:58,110 --> 00:02:01,440
job plus also all the key
aspects Oh, yeah, the event

36
00:02:01,440 --> 00:02:05,190
itself, like joy. I also have
some, some meetings besides it

37
00:02:05,190 --> 00:02:08,790
recording podcast with folks
like you, with the customers and

38
00:02:08,790 --> 00:02:11,100
also an evening meeting as well
too. So,

39
00:02:11,190 --> 00:02:13,170
Nicolas Blank: but we aren't
under oppression that you just

40
00:02:13,260 --> 00:02:14,910
your full time job is to be on
camera.

41
00:02:16,550 --> 00:02:17,540
Rick Claus: You'd be surprised.

42
00:02:18,110 --> 00:02:21,740
Joey Snow: nobody really wants
to see that actually a couple

43
00:02:21,740 --> 00:02:23,210
times here. Alright, that's
enough.

44
00:02:23,540 --> 00:02:25,820
Warren du Toit: So then what
technically is your job titles?

45
00:02:25,970 --> 00:02:27,470
But what is it? What do they
call you?

46
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:30,510
Rick Claus: So I'm actually
called a cloud advocate lead. So

47
00:02:30,510 --> 00:02:35,880
I built a team of seven people
that are smarter than me, that

48
00:02:35,880 --> 00:02:40,260
go off and create amazing
contents that is in demand by

49
00:02:40,260 --> 00:02:43,290
our customers and by our
partners, and by the community

50
00:02:43,290 --> 00:02:46,680
online that cover a variety of
topics. And my particular team

51
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:50,790
is focused on the operations
side of Azure, for the IT pro

52
00:02:50,790 --> 00:02:53,640
audience and for the architects
audience, for architecture,

53
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:56,130
primarily VMs but then also
talking a bit about Kubernetes

54
00:02:56,130 --> 00:02:59,280
and containers and future
looking and then also a bit in

55
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:02,910
the identity space. Security
space as well. But then we also

56
00:03:02,910 --> 00:03:06,180
handle the modernization of on
premises as well. A lot of our

57
00:03:06,180 --> 00:03:08,760
customers, the majority of the
customers that are out there are

58
00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:12,330
still very much having an on
premises focus. And we're trying

59
00:03:12,330 --> 00:03:14,460
to get them modernize, they can
start to take advantage of some

60
00:03:14,460 --> 00:03:17,280
of the goodness that is inside
of the Azure world.

61
00:03:18,020 --> 00:03:20,420
Joey Snow: I'm a Senior Program
Manager in the identity team. So

62
00:03:20,420 --> 00:03:23,150
I work in the Azure Active
Directory team. And what I do is

63
00:03:23,150 --> 00:03:26,810
I have inside of the engineering
team, we have a customer and

64
00:03:26,810 --> 00:03:29,810
partner experience team, which
is designed basically to help us

65
00:03:30,440 --> 00:03:34,220
get feedback back to our
engineering team faster, and

66
00:03:34,220 --> 00:03:37,670
help our customers get deployed
and to be successful. customers

67
00:03:37,670 --> 00:03:40,490
and partners as well. So I
manage a group of partners that

68
00:03:40,730 --> 00:03:44,360
help our customers get our
product deployed, get managed

69
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:47,900
services built around them, help
get them secure. All around

70
00:03:47,900 --> 00:03:49,310
identity in Azure Active
Directory.

71
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:53,620
Nicolas Blank: We love your
world. We ready. We had. Yeah,

72
00:03:53,830 --> 00:03:57,070
we had Elisabeth Olsen on early
on the show. Yeah, and second

73
00:03:57,070 --> 00:03:57,640
year in a row

74
00:03:57,990 --> 00:04:00,600
Joey Snow: and one of those
absolutely nothing. I can add to

75
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:01,170
this podcast.

76
00:04:02,909 --> 00:04:05,159
Nicolas Blank: Except that Rick
promise does that by you

77
00:04:05,159 --> 00:04:07,199
exceptionally good looks you'd
balance everything out.

78
00:04:07,320 --> 00:04:09,720
Rick Claus: Absolutely. Yeah. At
least his face for radio.

79
00:04:09,930 --> 00:04:11,640
Joey Snow: Yeah, I do I
completely have a face for radio

80
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:13,770
100%

81
00:04:14,099 --> 00:04:16,529
Warren du Toit: Yeah, your team.
Your team is the cloud. The

82
00:04:16,529 --> 00:04:18,839
cloud advocate teams are
incredible.

83
00:04:18,930 --> 00:04:20,580
Nicolas Blank: Yeah, we spent
some time with him on the road

84
00:04:20,580 --> 00:04:21,510
and they're amazing.

85
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:24,510
Warren du Toit: Yeah, thank you.
Yeah. Last year and in in Hong

86
00:04:24,510 --> 00:04:27,480
Kong. We got to mess around with

87
00:04:29,250 --> 00:04:29,910
it was good fun.

88
00:04:32,340 --> 00:04:36,150
Unknown: Yeah. Yeah, yeah.

89
00:04:36,180 --> 00:04:38,460
Rick Claus: Yeah. So biggest fun
this so this year we've expanded

90
00:04:38,820 --> 00:04:42,000
kicking off starting tomorrow,
which is Saturday when we're

91
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:45,270
recording this. I'm flying to
Paris and we're kicking off at

92
00:04:45,270 --> 00:04:48,570
night the tour 30 plus stops
around the world this time

93
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:52,140
double the number stops almost.
And my team will be at least one

94
00:04:52,140 --> 00:04:54,840
or two of my team will be at
every single city stuff to be a

95
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:58,440
luxury of coverage. So we have a
consistently high level of

96
00:04:58,440 --> 00:05:02,310
content and also high level of
engagement. So, if you look up,

97
00:05:02,460 --> 00:05:05,010
Microsoft Ignite the tour,
you'll see the cities they're

98
00:05:05,010 --> 00:05:08,130
free event you can go off and
subscribe to go off to and show

99
00:05:08,130 --> 00:05:10,470
up in your local city. It's
mostly international tour.

100
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:13,530
There's only I think three or
four cities in the US. Primarily

101
00:05:13,530 --> 00:05:16,710
international for China. Yes,
there's definitely more in

102
00:05:16,710 --> 00:05:22,140
China, Tokyo, Japan. And I'll be
in Beijing in December. I want

103
00:05:22,140 --> 00:05:24,330
to never been to Beijing before.
Yeah, I'll be fine.

104
00:05:24,450 --> 00:05:26,550
Nicolas Blank: Yeah, I'm on my
way to Shanghai right after this

105
00:05:26,550 --> 00:05:28,830
is the first time ever to
Shanghai as well. Awesome.

106
00:05:28,830 --> 00:05:30,690
Really, really? Looking forward
to that?

107
00:05:30,750 --> 00:05:32,430
Rick Claus: Yeah. Yeah, very
cool stuff.

108
00:05:32,820 --> 00:05:34,650
Nicolas Blank: So let's talk
about a topic just for a little

109
00:05:34,650 --> 00:05:35,460
bit. Oh, we know

110
00:05:35,460 --> 00:05:36,630
Rick Claus: we have topics.

111
00:05:38,790 --> 00:05:41,370
Joey Snow: I thought I was just
just here to chit chat,

112
00:05:41,780 --> 00:05:43,730
Warren du Toit: because it's
ties in nicely to the

113
00:05:43,730 --> 00:05:47,390
announcements that last week. So
if we have to look, one of the

114
00:05:47,390 --> 00:05:51,740
big announcements inside of
Agile was Arc. Yep. And that's

115
00:05:51,770 --> 00:05:55,820
multi cloud on prem. The whole
thing. What do you guys thoughts

116
00:05:55,820 --> 00:05:55,970
on that?

117
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:59,200
Nicolas Blank: Let's just define
Arc quickly for people who don't

118
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:02,410
know what that is. And go and
go.

119
00:06:05,130 --> 00:06:08,760
Rick Claus: See it. This is kind
of a test to see how the message

120
00:06:08,760 --> 00:06:12,630
was received by someone other
than Microsoft for that it was

121
00:06:12,630 --> 00:06:13,560
given. So I am curious.

122
00:06:14,110 --> 00:06:20,710
Warren du Toit: So it. So arc is
the ability to manage devices

123
00:06:20,740 --> 00:06:26,830
and servers and vdis and
containers and Kubernetes data.

124
00:06:26,830 --> 00:06:31,900
So workloads that aren't
necessarily inside of Azure. So

125
00:06:31,900 --> 00:06:36,640
they can be in AWS, they can be
on premises, and they can also

126
00:06:36,640 --> 00:06:40,750
help you move and manage those
workloads as well. And the

127
00:06:40,750 --> 00:06:45,280
biggest thing about Arc is that
it's free. When you think about

128
00:06:45,310 --> 00:06:49,090
what Amazon is charging Amazon,
which I think they're charging

129
00:06:49,090 --> 00:06:52,810
somewhere in the region of like
$8,000 a month per Kubernetes

130
00:06:52,810 --> 00:06:55,720
cluster, whatever the case may
be, is, where's free,

131
00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:58,240
Nicolas Blank: Joey I know that
I just saw a bit of a little bit

132
00:07:01,330 --> 00:07:01,780
Rick Claus: It worked.

133
00:07:03,150 --> 00:07:04,170
The messaging works.

134
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:08,130
So it's, it's a, it's an
architecture that allows you to,

135
00:07:09,480 --> 00:07:12,060
if you think about it in the in
the Agile world internally in

136
00:07:12,060 --> 00:07:14,370
engineering, and I think we
talked about this publicly to I

137
00:07:14,370 --> 00:07:17,640
should probably figure that out
for I say it. We talked about

138
00:07:17,640 --> 00:07:20,340
resource providers, right. So
the different resource providers

139
00:07:20,340 --> 00:07:23,130
to be able to spot up resources
inside of Azure as an example.

140
00:07:23,580 --> 00:07:25,920
we're extending that to also not
have resource providers that can

141
00:07:25,920 --> 00:07:29,070
work in different locations.
Because in case you didn't know,

142
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:33,330
other clouds are pretty
protective about their stuff.

143
00:07:33,330 --> 00:07:37,110
And they don't expose any API's
that expose anything the outside

144
00:07:37,110 --> 00:07:40,050
world, they want you to use
their management of monitoring

145
00:07:40,050 --> 00:07:43,290
tools, yeah, or for you to buy a
third party service to go in and

146
00:07:43,290 --> 00:07:45,870
to do those different management
and stuff. So we're basically

147
00:07:45,870 --> 00:07:50,160
now able to go in and to start
to bubble up stuff. You know,

148
00:07:50,460 --> 00:07:52,500
the first level of things that
gonna be going on are going to

149
00:07:52,500 --> 00:07:55,020
require some level of them and
have an install. Yeah, there's

150
00:07:55,020 --> 00:07:57,870
other areas. So you have to put
some stuff on the Kubernetes

151
00:07:57,870 --> 00:08:00,780
hosts to be able to go off the
nodes and the Management nodes,

152
00:08:00,930 --> 00:08:04,260
you have to be able to go in and
put in a hybrid resource

153
00:08:04,260 --> 00:08:07,530
provider for on premises
machines, but then they appear

154
00:08:07,530 --> 00:08:10,440
as resources inside of Azure.
And then once they're inside of

155
00:08:10,440 --> 00:08:12,930
Azure as a resource, then all
the goodness that is inside of

156
00:08:12,930 --> 00:08:15,600
Azure can take place. And you
can have log analytics take

157
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:18,750
place, you can have security
recommendations take place, you

158
00:08:18,750 --> 00:08:20,940
can have monitoring alerts and
performance alerts take place

159
00:08:20,940 --> 00:08:21,300
record and

160
00:08:21,330 --> 00:08:23,220
Warren du Toit: upgrade
Kubernetes even straight from

161
00:08:23,220 --> 00:08:23,640
the panel.

162
00:08:23,660 --> 00:08:28,400
Rick Claus: Yep. So so the the
capabilities are being laid out,

163
00:08:28,610 --> 00:08:32,150
and they'll be continuing to
evolve as they go. But it was a

164
00:08:32,150 --> 00:08:36,350
pretty substantial viewpoint
that we gave this earlier in the

165
00:08:36,350 --> 00:08:40,820
week with the initial keynote. I
think it was Gabe Gable gave one

166
00:08:41,240 --> 00:08:43,640
minority source a Monroe or
Malloy. It's been Ryan, I think

167
00:08:43,640 --> 00:08:46,280
it is. I should know this
because I said hello on the

168
00:08:46,280 --> 00:08:49,970
first day he joined Microsoft.
Back in the day from Colorado,

169
00:08:50,330 --> 00:08:53,840
he did a phenomenal demo about
how arc is gonna be going off

170
00:08:53,840 --> 00:08:54,200
and working.

171
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:56,700
Joey Snow: I think one of my
favorite components of arc and

172
00:08:56,700 --> 00:08:59,520
again, it's not a single thing,
right? Yeah. It's a set of it's

173
00:08:59,520 --> 00:09:02,700
a set of tech Everything you
have that allow things is the

174
00:09:02,700 --> 00:09:05,340
ability to do Policy and
Governance. So basically, it

175
00:09:05,340 --> 00:09:09,630
allows you to leverage some of
the configuration security

176
00:09:09,630 --> 00:09:13,440
configuration and governance of
the server is very, I mean,

177
00:09:13,470 --> 00:09:17,700
everybody probably knows Group
Policy. There are people in this

178
00:09:17,700 --> 00:09:23,520
world that have on their resume.
I'm a group policy expert. And

179
00:09:23,520 --> 00:09:26,160
they know how to do that. You
can think of some of the

180
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:30,000
components of arc and managing
and these policies is kind of

181
00:09:30,060 --> 00:09:33,090
like a group policy. This is the
next 20 years. Yeah, so for the

182
00:09:33,090 --> 00:09:36,990
past 20 years, we've been doing
group policy on premises, right?

183
00:09:36,990 --> 00:09:40,800
So you can think of this and,
and, and mostly on the server

184
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:44,010
side, as that's, that's how
you're going to manage those

185
00:09:44,010 --> 00:09:47,160
configurations. And you can take
some of the the practices that

186
00:09:47,160 --> 00:09:50,970
we already have, when you spin
up Azure VMs and some of those

187
00:09:50,970 --> 00:09:55,050
things and and apply those same
policies in a very consistent

188
00:09:55,050 --> 00:09:58,860
manner to resources regardless
of where those resources live.

189
00:09:58,890 --> 00:10:04,500
Yeah, and is really just kind of
this next step. As we move

190
00:10:04,500 --> 00:10:09,510
toward we talked multi cloud and
multi cloud can exist on

191
00:10:09,510 --> 00:10:10,380
premises as well.

192
00:10:10,510 --> 00:10:13,570
Nicolas Blank: What about my on
premises VMware estate?

193
00:10:16,110 --> 00:10:18,990
Rick Claus: Initially, we're
looking at doing it from a VM

194
00:10:18,990 --> 00:10:21,300
inside of the host
configuration, right? We're not

195
00:10:21,300 --> 00:10:23,490
looking at the individual lower
level fabrics at this point in

196
00:10:23,490 --> 00:10:26,220
time. It's a natural extension.
Again, I don't want to say any

197
00:10:26,220 --> 00:10:28,230
for looking statements, they
don't have the details to be

198
00:10:28,230 --> 00:10:32,370
able to pry out of me, which is
good. But if I look at it, I

199
00:10:32,370 --> 00:10:34,920
just see a VM as a VM as a VM. I
don't care where it is.

200
00:10:37,410 --> 00:10:40,320
redeliver don't at this time,
have any kind of inter lower

201
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:44,160
level knowledge of what's
happening down below. Until you

202
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:47,520
start going into things like our
migration tools. Our migration

203
00:10:47,520 --> 00:10:49,680
tools do have the ability to go
in to take a look at the

204
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:51,060
underlaying v cloud platform,

205
00:10:51,059 --> 00:10:54,149
Warren du Toit: which has also
been completely redone, updated

206
00:10:54,149 --> 00:10:54,929
data and yeah, this

207
00:10:54,929 --> 00:10:56,969
Rick Claus: week, don't ask me
questions that one there as I

208
00:10:56,969 --> 00:10:57,869
haven't read that one yet.

209
00:10:59,730 --> 00:11:01,560
There's a Book of news in case
you're wondering

210
00:11:02,340 --> 00:11:03,180
Nicolas Blank: about that. Yeah.

211
00:11:03,380 --> 00:11:05,390
Rick Claus: The Book of news is
available for download from the

212
00:11:05,390 --> 00:11:08,630
news.microsoft.com website that
lists off. And you were saying

213
00:11:08,690 --> 00:11:10,640
the Table of Contents how many
page Long's remember,

214
00:11:10,679 --> 00:11:14,159
Joey Snow: I think I want to say
it was 14 or 15 pages, just the

215
00:11:14,159 --> 00:11:15,359
Table of Contents? Yes,

216
00:11:15,410 --> 00:11:18,410
Rick Claus: it was insane. And
then it has the details of all

217
00:11:18,410 --> 00:11:21,140
the different functions and
features that we announced this

218
00:11:21,170 --> 00:11:23,870
or rather, the solutions that
we've announced, we no longer do

219
00:11:23,870 --> 00:11:24,980
the functions and features thing
anymore.

220
00:11:25,560 --> 00:11:27,960
Nicolas Blank: But How exciting
is that I have a virtual

221
00:11:27,960 --> 00:11:30,420
machine, which could be on just
about anything could be VMware,

222
00:11:30,420 --> 00:11:34,170
it could be on open stack, it
could be on whatever. And I can

223
00:11:34,170 --> 00:11:37,920
see it in portal and I can
report an instrument on it.

224
00:11:38,410 --> 00:11:41,230
Rick Claus: To me, that's going
to be invaluable. I mean, the

225
00:11:41,230 --> 00:11:43,330
customers that I've seen, I
talked with as well, as I

226
00:11:43,330 --> 00:11:46,360
mentioned, a lot of people than
in the space that I work in with

227
00:11:46,360 --> 00:11:50,830
modernization are very much in a
now I'm starting to look at the

228
00:11:50,830 --> 00:11:54,220
cloud. I mean, in your
consultancies, working much more

229
00:11:54,220 --> 00:11:56,380
cloud forward, you're dealing
with a lot of customers that are

230
00:11:56,380 --> 00:11:58,990
very much cutting edge and
wanting to be there. Now we're

231
00:11:58,990 --> 00:12:01,900
starting to see that happen.
first level of the curve has

232
00:12:01,900 --> 00:12:04,840
gone and coming and they're
there and they buy into it. Now

233
00:12:04,840 --> 00:12:07,960
we've got this big massive wave
coming behind them that are now

234
00:12:07,990 --> 00:12:10,270
starting to be able to come
forward and want to want to know

235
00:12:10,270 --> 00:12:13,000
what to do. So yeah, the the
ability to include them and have

236
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,460
them visible inside the inside
the portal, as you mentioned,

237
00:12:15,460 --> 00:12:17,950
the able to put policy against
them and our back against them

238
00:12:17,950 --> 00:12:21,520
and stuff like that. The ability
to install the hybrid agent on

239
00:12:21,520 --> 00:12:24,490
the different machines, it's
going to be very powerful. And

240
00:12:24,490 --> 00:12:26,620
as you mentioned, the very
beginning of all this, it's not

241
00:12:26,620 --> 00:12:30,940
just VMs yet VMs is obviously
where 80% of our customers are

242
00:12:30,940 --> 00:12:32,950
going to be right now for what
they're comfortable with working

243
00:12:32,950 --> 00:12:36,550
with net new development or or
modernization of existing

244
00:12:36,550 --> 00:12:39,280
workloads that are being
reimagined off of VMs into

245
00:12:39,280 --> 00:12:42,400
something more compact, are
going to be looking at

246
00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:44,920
containers to reduce is the
current winner in that space.

247
00:12:45,280 --> 00:12:47,980
And then also potentially re
architect and looking at even

248
00:12:47,980 --> 00:12:50,620
avoiding Kubernetes and going
straight to a microservices

249
00:12:50,620 --> 00:12:54,400
architecture and said all that's
coming down the road, but more

250
00:12:54,400 --> 00:12:57,700
and more people are looking at
how can I get immediate value

251
00:12:57,700 --> 00:13:01,600
now? using something like arc
Using the hybrid RP and other

252
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:04,420
things like that, to put all the
stuff inside of one, one spot,

253
00:13:04,450 --> 00:13:08,230
it sounds marketing, but, you
know, one pane of glass, the

254
00:13:08,230 --> 00:13:09,280
ideas all in one spot.

255
00:13:09,659 --> 00:13:11,639
Nicolas Blank: It's like the
show's done, we can leave. Okay,

256
00:13:12,630 --> 00:13:14,460
Joey Snow: great talking, ever
done.

257
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:16,680
Warren du Toit: Now we can go
back to what we were originally

258
00:13:16,680 --> 00:13:17,130
talking about.

259
00:13:19,080 --> 00:13:21,150
Joey Snow: But But listen, you
know, when we talk about the

260
00:13:21,150 --> 00:13:23,610
cloud, it was interesting I had
a conversation with Aaron

261
00:13:23,610 --> 00:13:28,140
chapel. And and it's, it's kind
of the the it comes in waves,

262
00:13:28,140 --> 00:13:31,350
right? And you look it's like,
okay, we're going to do this

263
00:13:31,350 --> 00:13:33,870
thing on prem, then you move to
the cloud, and then you're

264
00:13:33,930 --> 00:13:36,690
expanding out beyond clouds. And
then there may come a time where

265
00:13:36,690 --> 00:13:39,960
you eventually have to come back
down again. Yes, right. But you

266
00:13:39,960 --> 00:13:43,080
need to still be able to treat
those those resources if that as

267
00:13:43,080 --> 00:13:46,110
if they are a true cloud,
scalable resources and all the

268
00:13:46,110 --> 00:13:49,830
things that they were working on
and Azure and the announcements

269
00:13:49,830 --> 00:13:54,660
that they made around that the
arc stuff this, this ignite,

270
00:13:55,020 --> 00:13:59,130
that's exactly what they're
doing. So it's it's not so much

271
00:13:59,130 --> 00:14:02,790
wear anymore. And it's just
using that methodology.

272
00:14:02,970 --> 00:14:07,050
Rick Claus: Yeah, I think there
was a tweet that Jeff Woolsey

273
00:14:07,050 --> 00:14:11,160
put out, which was hilarious.
This week. He's like, our hybrid

274
00:14:11,160 --> 00:14:17,430
strategy is a true and full
planned out. Complete strategy,

275
00:14:17,460 --> 00:14:20,970
multi cloud on premises
exclusively cloud exclusively on

276
00:14:20,970 --> 00:14:23,370
premises. Then also multi cloud
as well

277
00:14:23,570 --> 00:14:24,770
Warren du Toit: as the
intelligent edge net

278
00:14:24,770 --> 00:14:26,930
Rick Claus: and intelligent edge
as well. Yeah. And he's like,

279
00:14:27,080 --> 00:14:31,010
it's not a checkbox. It's right.
It's not like oh, other cloud

280
00:14:31,010 --> 00:14:33,950
vendor. Yeah, we do hybrid
check. Yes, they can get past

281
00:14:33,950 --> 00:14:36,980
the RFC or something like that.
We actually have a full

282
00:14:36,980 --> 00:14:39,200
documented way of how we can go
off and do this sort of stuff.

283
00:14:39,299 --> 00:14:41,549
Joey Snow: It's important to
know that the reality is, is

284
00:14:41,549 --> 00:14:44,939
hybrids going to exist for a
very long time. Oh, yeah. And

285
00:14:44,939 --> 00:14:47,669
it's something that we take very
seriously inside of inside of

286
00:14:47,669 --> 00:14:50,819
active directory, Azure Active
Directory, and making sure that

287
00:14:50,819 --> 00:14:55,559
we have the the ability to
provide the security, to provide

288
00:14:55,559 --> 00:14:58,529
the governance and to provide
the compliance is absolutely

289
00:14:58,529 --> 00:15:04,259
key, no matter where you are. So
we spent a lot of time here at

290
00:15:04,259 --> 00:15:08,279
Ignite, complementing a lot of
that hybrid messaging that was

291
00:15:08,279 --> 00:15:11,339
occurring, not just on the
platform side, but also on the

292
00:15:11,339 --> 00:15:15,149
identity side, right? We start
looking at how can you secure

293
00:15:15,479 --> 00:15:17,429
and manage those identities that

294
00:15:17,519 --> 00:15:20,159
Warren du Toit: you see that's,
that's why security has moved.

295
00:15:20,459 --> 00:15:24,659
So, again, so like one of my
sessions now that I'm doing in

296
00:15:24,659 --> 00:15:26,579
a, in a couple minutes is on

297
00:15:32,279 --> 00:15:34,799
is firewalls inside of Azure,
right network virtual

298
00:15:34,799 --> 00:15:38,309
appliances, and how people still
need them because of certain

299
00:15:38,339 --> 00:15:44,369
things. But Id, the firewalls
not the protection mechanism

300
00:15:44,369 --> 00:15:49,199
anymore, not the person, right?
So identity, yes. So so the

301
00:15:49,199 --> 00:15:52,889
identity is the way you secure
your resources. It's not the

302
00:15:52,889 --> 00:15:55,919
fact that your SQL Servers out
on the internet now it's got

303
00:15:55,919 --> 00:15:59,489
nothing to do with that anymore.
So we're moving in that way. I

304
00:15:59,489 --> 00:16:01,739
didn't The most important thing
they

305
00:16:01,780 --> 00:16:05,050
Joey Snow: the way I talk about
this is that before we kind of

306
00:16:05,050 --> 00:16:08,470
had all of these things together
inside we had, we have the user

307
00:16:08,470 --> 00:16:12,400
of the identity you had the
platform of the devices, the

308
00:16:12,400 --> 00:16:15,850
server, the application, you
have the data. And and and

309
00:16:15,880 --> 00:16:18,460
really Group Policy and some of
the things that we had inside of

310
00:16:18,790 --> 00:16:22,240
remedy did a little of this and
a little about the kind of cross

311
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:25,090
all of them with Azure Active
Directory, we had to split that

312
00:16:25,090 --> 00:16:27,430
out. And we have Look, it's an
if that's what it is. It's

313
00:16:27,430 --> 00:16:30,910
purely an identity provider. And
it's the one that we want

314
00:16:30,910 --> 00:16:35,980
everybody to use. And it does
one thing, which is identity and

315
00:16:35,980 --> 00:16:41,110
imagine that it protects it. You
want to connect your apps to the

316
00:16:41,110 --> 00:16:43,900
identity have that single
identity that is protected

317
00:16:43,900 --> 00:16:47,110
because it is that Alex Simon's
likes to call it the control

318
00:16:47,110 --> 00:16:49,090
plane, we've done a lot of
controlling talking around the

319
00:16:49,090 --> 00:16:52,990
outside of here, it but that's
it, it's that single place. It's

320
00:16:53,290 --> 00:16:58,510
that one place and you know that
that identity is is trusted and

321
00:16:58,870 --> 00:17:02,050
and then more importantly, That
the session that the identity

322
00:17:02,380 --> 00:17:06,340
has actually initiated is also
trusted, insecure. Yeah. So you

323
00:17:06,340 --> 00:17:09,460
know, it's first make sure you
turn on MFA because password

324
00:17:09,460 --> 00:17:13,780
suck. And until we can get rid
of that and we're in we really

325
00:17:13,780 --> 00:17:16,420
are in the process of doing it.
I think we've crossed the chasm

326
00:17:16,420 --> 00:17:22,630
now, in terms of over a million
identities are managed

327
00:17:22,630 --> 00:17:23,620
passwordless so far.

328
00:17:23,660 --> 00:17:25,460
Nicolas Blank: And we some of
those we've been running

329
00:17:25,490 --> 00:17:26,210
passwordless for months. Yep,

330
00:17:26,540 --> 00:17:29,120
Joey Snow: absolutely. So a lot
of investments a lot of talk

331
00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:32,060
around password list that is
real. these are these are things

332
00:17:32,060 --> 00:17:35,990
you can do today. And and
eventually it's our it's our

333
00:17:35,990 --> 00:17:39,650
goal in our mission to get rid
of passwords all together, and

334
00:17:39,650 --> 00:17:45,110
then in the future, change the
way identity is. So yeah, it's

335
00:17:45,110 --> 00:17:48,440
it's super cool and exciting.
That I think my favorite part

336
00:17:48,440 --> 00:17:52,310
about this is that just like the
the arc things, this all can be

337
00:17:52,310 --> 00:17:55,880
done now and it can all be done
across no matter where you are.

338
00:17:55,910 --> 00:18:00,620
Yeah. And if you're if you're on
prem, you're in Azure. You're in

339
00:18:00,620 --> 00:18:01,520
other clouds.

340
00:18:01,580 --> 00:18:04,730
Warren du Toit: And it's, it's
not hard either. No, it No it's,

341
00:18:04,790 --> 00:18:07,820
you know, to me like to turn MFA
on or to take your password away

342
00:18:07,820 --> 00:18:10,580
is really not hard you like take
out a box and it's gone.

343
00:18:10,830 --> 00:18:13,260
Nicolas Blank: or to even bring
your own identity and federate

344
00:18:13,260 --> 00:18:17,610
through Google, but still manage
your object and Azure AD b2b

345
00:18:17,640 --> 00:18:21,060
again. So there's so much
goodness in there and then

346
00:18:21,090 --> 00:18:24,210
policy and control them. And I
still only have one direction. I

347
00:18:24,210 --> 00:18:25,020
think that's wonderful.

348
00:18:25,050 --> 00:18:27,750
Joey Snow: Yeah, we're
leveraging conditional access

349
00:18:27,750 --> 00:18:29,370
and the things that we can do
through conditional access

350
00:18:29,370 --> 00:18:33,900
policies is really kind of the
game changer. Yeah. I kind of

351
00:18:33,900 --> 00:18:36,780
look at turning on MFA is it's
kind of three major things when

352
00:18:36,780 --> 00:18:39,480
you turn on MFA for everything
for everyone, which is really a

353
00:18:39,480 --> 00:18:43,890
bad experience. As somebody who
was on the early side, when we

354
00:18:43,890 --> 00:18:48,030
did it at Microsoft, it's like
oh my gosh, yeah. And and and

355
00:18:48,030 --> 00:18:51,390
I've actually had customers that
that have gone through this

356
00:18:51,390 --> 00:18:54,270
route and I was just I was I was
just over in Ireland. I was

357
00:18:54,270 --> 00:18:56,580
speaking with a customer and and
they're really struggling

358
00:18:56,580 --> 00:18:59,370
because they did this the first
time and it was not a good

359
00:18:59,370 --> 00:19:04,680
experiences. Their CIO is really
hesitant to go do it again. But

360
00:19:04,680 --> 00:19:07,380
now we actually through
conditional access, and that's,

361
00:19:07,380 --> 00:19:10,230
that's stage two, right? Yeah.
Being able to do conditional

362
00:19:10,230 --> 00:19:15,870
access and make those, you know,
rules around when do you based

363
00:19:15,870 --> 00:19:18,120
on your location, your risk
those those types of things. And

364
00:19:18,120 --> 00:19:21,540
then that third step is taking
it out of the hands of it to

365
00:19:21,990 --> 00:19:25,530
making, making the termination
of if the user is risky, or the

366
00:19:25,530 --> 00:19:29,070
session is risky. And that's all
that's all around identity

367
00:19:29,070 --> 00:19:31,650
protection. And that's by
leveraging the trillions and

368
00:19:31,650 --> 00:19:34,350
trillions and trillions of
signals that we get every single

369
00:19:34,350 --> 00:19:37,830
day. We a lot of people
donorship we authenticate 45

370
00:19:37,860 --> 00:19:40,470
billion authentications in a
month.

371
00:19:43,210 --> 00:19:47,440
Warren du Toit: Tenant to tenant
migration, right? Yep. Tenant to

372
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:49,210
tenant migration is hard.

373
00:19:49,920 --> 00:19:52,110
Joey Snow: Yes. Yes.

374
00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:54,120
Warren du Toit: And I blame you

375
00:19:57,750 --> 00:20:00,000
Joey Snow: know, we know and
this is this is this is very

376
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,800
work this is work that we're
doing. Yeah,

377
00:20:02,520 --> 00:20:06,270
it's work that we continue to do
I and I don't want to make any

378
00:20:06,270 --> 00:20:09,780
like like I'm gonna stay away
from for for statements but this

379
00:20:09,780 --> 00:20:12,000
is the type of feedback but it's
also the feedback the

380
00:20:12,300 --> 00:20:13,800
information that we need.

381
00:20:13,830 --> 00:20:16,830
Warren du Toit: Yeah no show and
it's why the inevitably

382
00:20:16,830 --> 00:20:19,560
accompanies going to be bought
or sold. Always always

383
00:20:19,540 --> 00:20:22,480
Joey Snow: gonna have look m&a
and some of our biggest. But

384
00:20:22,870 --> 00:20:26,290
there's also it's also
opportunity. Yeah, right. We

385
00:20:26,320 --> 00:20:31,180
look at it as something that we
have to address, because that's

386
00:20:31,180 --> 00:20:37,480
what our customers are doing
this. And I want to be clear, we

387
00:20:37,540 --> 00:20:40,360
don't do anything inside of
Azure Active Directory unless

388
00:20:40,360 --> 00:20:44,110
there's a customer need to do
it. Yeah. We no longer sit in a

389
00:20:44,110 --> 00:20:47,710
room on whiteboards and come up
with shiny disco ball things

390
00:20:47,710 --> 00:20:50,920
thinking, well, if we could only
get our customers to adopt this,

391
00:20:51,070 --> 00:20:54,790
yeah, it doesn't even get to the
next stage until there's a

392
00:20:54,790 --> 00:20:59,440
customer story. Every time we
build a new feature inside of

393
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:03,070
the service It is tempted inside
of a private preview first

394
00:21:03,070 --> 00:21:05,770
before it goes out into a
broader public preview. All the

395
00:21:05,770 --> 00:21:08,260
feedback comes in all the
changes and modifications. And

396
00:21:08,260 --> 00:21:11,620
there are times that something
will sit in that public preview

397
00:21:11,620 --> 00:21:14,800
for a considerable amount of
time, because maybe we didn't

398
00:21:14,800 --> 00:21:19,330
get it exactly right in the
first time. Us, it's up to us to

399
00:21:19,330 --> 00:21:22,660
make that modification based on
what our customers needs not not

400
00:21:22,660 --> 00:21:25,870
how we look at that. And then,
you know, we'll obviously put it

401
00:21:25,870 --> 00:21:29,560
into GA. And that is something
that's why I am in the space.

402
00:21:29,590 --> 00:21:33,640
That's why I'm in the team. We
are that customer obsessed. I've

403
00:21:33,670 --> 00:21:37,930
80 engineers here that have been
just absolutely inundated in the

404
00:21:37,930 --> 00:21:42,070
booth, in addition to doing
sessions on the developer side

405
00:21:42,100 --> 00:21:46,150
is is there's a lot of stuff
happening there in terms of, as

406
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:49,030
Rick mentioned, with application
modernization and monetization

407
00:21:49,120 --> 00:21:52,090
platform to modernize the
identity piece as well. Yeah.

408
00:21:52,090 --> 00:21:57,970
And you have to move start
moving things up. And so it's

409
00:21:57,970 --> 00:22:00,700
just really important for folks
to understand it. There's a lot

410
00:22:00,700 --> 00:22:04,840
of hard things. We're also
trying to make life easier

411
00:22:04,840 --> 00:22:08,440
because identity is at its core
can be a very challenging thing

412
00:22:08,440 --> 00:22:12,910
to do. Oh, yes. It used to be,
you know, five years and, and

413
00:22:12,910 --> 00:22:15,310
and the slide deck that you paid
a million dollars for that had

414
00:22:15,340 --> 00:22:17,950
15 Chevron's at the top and you
can't do a single thing until

415
00:22:17,950 --> 00:22:21,670
you tick off all those 15
pieces. Now you can't do that

416
00:22:21,670 --> 00:22:24,790
anymore with you've got to
protect that thing. First turn

417
00:22:24,790 --> 00:22:29,140
on him. If you do nothing else,
turn on MFA. Yeah, via

418
00:22:29,140 --> 00:22:31,420
conditional access and get that
identity protected. And then we

419
00:22:31,420 --> 00:22:33,820
can start moving down the path
of doing things like

420
00:22:33,820 --> 00:22:37,930
provisioning and de provisioning
and which we can already do. You

421
00:22:37,930 --> 00:22:41,020
can actually we have inbound
provisioning through workday.

422
00:22:41,710 --> 00:22:44,740
We're working on other platforms
as well and integration there to

423
00:22:44,740 --> 00:22:47,260
do inbound provisioning. You can
do outbound provisioning with a

424
00:22:47,260 --> 00:22:53,350
whole ton of applications of
1.3. We might be at 1.4 million

425
00:22:53,350 --> 00:22:55,240
applications that have
integration with Azure Active

426
00:22:55,240 --> 00:22:55,930
Directory today.

427
00:22:56,590 --> 00:22:57,940
Nicolas Blank: How many again so
that number

428
00:22:57,000 --> 00:23:00,420
Joey Snow: is we're probably
close to 1.4. I don't We were

429
00:23:00,420 --> 00:23:02,490
1.3. That number is two months
old.

430
00:23:03,180 --> 00:23:04,920
Nicolas Blank: Those are
discrete applications.

431
00:23:04,950 --> 00:23:07,050
Joey Snow: Those are
applications that currently have

432
00:23:07,050 --> 00:23:10,590
integration with Azure Active
Directory. Yep. Yep. But that,

433
00:23:10,590 --> 00:23:11,550
but that does not show

434
00:23:12,350 --> 00:23:15,800
Warren du Toit: PowerShell  is
one of them. And so all the

435
00:23:15,830 --> 00:23:18,590
other applications that use
PowerShell in the back to make

436
00:23:18,590 --> 00:23:19,790
those commands counts as one.

437
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:23,120
Nicolas Blank: Rick what did you
do last summer.

438
00:23:24,290 --> 00:23:25,850
Joey Snow: And then and then the
other thing too

439
00:23:25,880 --> 00:23:28,670
Rick Claus: Painted my house,
worked on my Jeep.

440
00:23:29,320 --> 00:23:32,470
Joey Snow: We made a lot of
announcements here at Ignite,

441
00:23:32,470 --> 00:23:35,920
and recently around partnerships
that we have with things like

442
00:23:35,950 --> 00:23:40,900
five Yes, where now we can
expose applications behind those

443
00:23:40,930 --> 00:23:43,840
five appliances. But here's the
cool thing. You can set the

444
00:23:43,840 --> 00:23:46,540
policy on the individual
application. You're not just

445
00:23:46,540 --> 00:23:50,560
doing it Oh, everything that
hits the applied. So that

446
00:23:50,560 --> 00:23:53,770
changes how you can modernize
your applications as well.

447
00:23:53,770 --> 00:23:58,120
Right? Yeah, we do. So So we've
been spending a lot of time on

448
00:23:58,120 --> 00:24:02,290
that because we as you mentioned
It's not the thing anymore, not

449
00:24:02,290 --> 00:24:05,590
the firewall, we have to start
going, how do we get these apps?

450
00:24:06,070 --> 00:24:10,750
And 1.3 1.4 million apps is
awesome. But we have to make

451
00:24:10,750 --> 00:24:12,910
sure that we hit the ones
everybody is using. And that's

452
00:24:12,910 --> 00:24:16,090
exactly what we've done. Yeah.
So the top application providers

453
00:24:16,090 --> 00:24:19,600
that that, that need
authentication, we have those

454
00:24:19,630 --> 00:24:21,970
partnerships with them, and they
can do the things that we want

455
00:24:21,970 --> 00:24:25,180
them to do. And it's all
standards based. So we're not

456
00:24:25,180 --> 00:24:28,330
going out and creating some new
wild wacky way to connect

457
00:24:28,330 --> 00:24:31,510
things. Yeah, right. We
provision through scam. Right?

458
00:24:31,510 --> 00:24:34,510
We do we do password list
through Fido2. To we contribute

459
00:24:34,510 --> 00:24:36,940
to the standards, I did an
interview with Pamela Dingle,

460
00:24:37,090 --> 00:24:39,310
whose entire job she's a
director in product marketing.

461
00:24:39,310 --> 00:24:42,880
She works for Alex Simon's in
our org, and all she does is

462
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:49,180
standards. And it's it's
incredible. The amount of effort

463
00:24:49,210 --> 00:24:52,600
and time and contributions that
we're making to these standards

464
00:24:52,600 --> 00:24:55,480
to ensure that we can do this,
not just now and doing it the

465
00:24:55,480 --> 00:24:56,200
right way, but doing it

466
00:24:56,660 --> 00:24:58,550
Warren du Toit: the right way.
We were talking to Julia (Foran)

467
00:24:58,550 --> 00:24:59,090
the other day.

468
00:25:01,580 --> 00:25:06,500
I've got this thing about ICS
standards. Yeah, a calendar

469
00:25:06,500 --> 00:25:12,470
invite follows those standards,
because they're all different

470
00:25:12,470 --> 00:25:12,890
man.

471
00:25:14,910 --> 00:25:16,470
Joey Snow: If you want to have
if you want to have real fun

472
00:25:16,470 --> 00:25:19,980
with standards Go Go read the
CSP standard. Really? Yeah.

473
00:25:20,370 --> 00:25:22,200
What's hardcore? Oh, it's a hot
mess.

474
00:25:23,590 --> 00:25:25,090
Nicolas Blank: it's a hot mess

475
00:25:25,090 --> 00:25:27,460
Joey Snow: it's a hot mess. It's
all we're doing things that was

476
00:25:27,460 --> 00:25:28,180
never meant is it?

477
00:25:28,380 --> 00:25:29,640
Warren du Toit: Is it is that
comma?

478
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:32,630
Rick Claus: Is the quote of the
show right there. It's a hot

479
00:25:32,630 --> 00:25:32,930
mess.

480
00:25:34,550 --> 00:25:37,100
Joey Snow: That's what Pamela
told me anyway. Yeah, it's it.

481
00:25:37,100 --> 00:25:43,190
Look at DNS it's always DNS.
Yeah we always blame DNS.

482
00:25:44,150 --> 00:25:44,720
Nicolas Blank: or networking

483
00:25:44,750 --> 00:25:47,000
Rick Claus: I have a question
for you. Actually. Yeah. If you

484
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:50,840
don't mind me, please. I mean,
the show timeline. No, I like

485
00:25:50,870 --> 00:25:56,360
well, it's my turn to talk about
the, the the, the question the

486
00:25:56,360 --> 00:25:58,580
the one of the topics we're
talking about today is obviously

487
00:25:58,580 --> 00:26:01,280
going to be multi cloud
management, sort of Do you have

488
00:26:01,280 --> 00:26:04,430
customers asking for this? Is it
only that first level of

489
00:26:04,430 --> 00:26:07,100
introductory people that are
going that path? Or is everyone

490
00:26:07,100 --> 00:26:10,310
asking for this? Because Is it a
checkbox exercise? So or is it a

491
00:26:10,310 --> 00:26:12,920
real actual ask? That's
happened.

492
00:26:13,140 --> 00:26:14,700
Warren du Toit: So to be honest
with you, I think is a real

493
00:26:14,700 --> 00:26:21,480
risk. Because you'll see that a
particular client will never put

494
00:26:21,480 --> 00:26:27,840
together just an Azure framework
for their company. They want it

495
00:26:27,840 --> 00:26:31,710
to be a cloud framework. So they
want to make sure that these

496
00:26:31,710 --> 00:26:35,400
policies cover everything moving
forward, because it's a big

497
00:26:35,400 --> 00:26:38,730
change for them. So they've now
gone and set down policies who

498
00:26:38,730 --> 00:26:41,700
can do this, you can do that
that can be spun up that can't

499
00:26:41,700 --> 00:26:44,070
wait, it can be accessed the
portal from and that all gets

500
00:26:44,070 --> 00:26:47,460
documented. But there's no point
in doing it just for Azure.

501
00:26:47,790 --> 00:26:50,760
You'll see some of the banks in
South Africa, for instance, have

502
00:26:50,760 --> 00:26:54,930
done AWS first course right and
now they're putting that AWS

503
00:26:54,930 --> 00:26:59,670
document to blueprints and
obviously with something like

504
00:26:59,670 --> 00:27:03,660
lights coming out as well,
which, you know, manages those

505
00:27:03,660 --> 00:27:10,590
blueprints across all those all
those different tenants. Yes, I

506
00:27:10,590 --> 00:27:14,340
would say having a single place
to manage all those things is

507
00:27:14,340 --> 00:27:18,750
very important, because some of
them already have them. I mean,

508
00:27:18,780 --> 00:27:24,060
you'll see Cape Town, for
instance, has a very large, AWS

509
00:27:24,060 --> 00:27:25,290
huge, huge country.

510
00:27:26,370 --> 00:27:28,980
Nicolas Blank: In particular
sectors like like retail. Yeah,

511
00:27:28,980 --> 00:27:29,910
retail loves Amazon,

512
00:27:30,110 --> 00:27:33,290
Warren du Toit: because for some
reason you got these diehard

513
00:27:33,290 --> 00:27:37,580
Linux dudes who haven't seen the
light, and they're like, if

514
00:27:37,580 --> 00:27:41,630
you're a Linux person, then you
have to go AWS and be faithful,

515
00:27:42,530 --> 00:27:45,560
which is like, the wrong way
around. I mean, we know this. I

516
00:27:45,560 --> 00:27:50,270
mean, I'm a Linux boy. And, you
know, Microsoft is number one

517
00:27:50,270 --> 00:27:53,870
open source contributor on the
planet, but no, no, you're

518
00:27:53,870 --> 00:28:00,770
betraying the you betraying the
shell betraying the Shell, it's

519
00:28:00,770 --> 00:28:01,430
a hot mess.

520
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:06,250
Joey Snow: Gonna be trading
between betraying the shell and

521
00:28:06,970 --> 00:28:10,030
hot mess are now the themes of
this particular episode of the

522
00:28:10,030 --> 00:28:10,630
podcast.

523
00:28:11,850 --> 00:28:13,680
Warren du Toit: So to answer
your question is I think it's I

524
00:28:13,680 --> 00:28:14,100
think it's,

525
00:28:14,160 --> 00:28:16,050
Nicolas Blank: I'll give you my
spin on this as well and then

526
00:28:16,050 --> 00:28:19,740
I'll, I'll maybe ask you to
comment on it. So my biggest ask

527
00:28:19,740 --> 00:28:22,710
for customers going multicloud
is that they're trying to avoid

528
00:28:22,830 --> 00:28:27,870
vendor lock in. So I'll put a
little bit here put a little bit

529
00:28:27,870 --> 00:28:30,690
day while use the commercial
angle is, as you know, well that

530
00:28:31,020 --> 00:28:33,780
I'm going to tell Microsoft
there, I'm going to do a

531
00:28:33,780 --> 00:28:36,900
percentage of my workload on
another cloud, no matter how

532
00:28:36,900 --> 00:28:40,290
well or how badly it does it
because I'm trying to avoid

533
00:28:40,290 --> 00:28:43,140
commercial lock and I want to
commercial angle. The biggest

534
00:28:43,260 --> 00:28:47,250
pain for me on that is
management overhead. And having

535
00:28:47,280 --> 00:28:52,140
a there's there's no single pane
on anything. There's multiple

536
00:28:52,140 --> 00:28:54,690
places of ordered. There's
multiple management and

537
00:28:54,750 --> 00:28:57,990
infrastructures, having to spend
a lot of money with third

538
00:28:57,990 --> 00:29:01,770
parties to get those logs into
central location which tends to

539
00:29:01,770 --> 00:29:03,930
be on premises, right? And not
scale.

540
00:29:05,160 --> 00:29:11,400
Rick Claus: Yep. So I agree with
that. At the same time. What I

541
00:29:11,400 --> 00:29:13,830
find is interesting is some
customers that are jumping into

542
00:29:13,830 --> 00:29:17,760
this conversation without
thoroughly thinking it out is I

543
00:29:17,760 --> 00:29:20,280
forget who mentioned it was on
online, they were talking about

544
00:29:20,280 --> 00:29:22,710
how, if you look at doing
adopting a multi cloud

545
00:29:22,710 --> 00:29:25,800
environments, you're not going
to get the full depth and

546
00:29:25,800 --> 00:29:28,620
breadth of the power of that
particular platform vendor.

547
00:29:28,770 --> 00:29:32,130
Yeah, because you have to leave
only so much so deep. And that

548
00:29:32,130 --> 00:29:34,680
applies to all three of the
clouds. Yeah, that's out there.

549
00:29:34,950 --> 00:29:38,700
That's what I find the the
concept of arc very interesting,

550
00:29:39,060 --> 00:29:42,870
because it doesn't matter to us
where those resources happen to

551
00:29:42,870 --> 00:29:46,770
be will give you the insights.
So we're kind of like your, I'm

552
00:29:46,770 --> 00:29:49,320
not going to call it a seven
device, but we're kind of like

553
00:29:49,320 --> 00:29:53,310
that inside of the Azure space.
Because we bring stuff back into

554
00:29:53,310 --> 00:29:56,160
duty now analytics on it, but
you can leave your Kubernetes

555
00:29:56,160 --> 00:29:59,280
running over an AWS if you want
to. You can have your your

556
00:30:00,060 --> 00:30:04,200
elastic compute or go off and do
Nvidia AI type stuff in Google

557
00:30:04,200 --> 00:30:07,590
if you want to do but you can
also do it here too. And that's

558
00:30:07,620 --> 00:30:11,250
true for as I mentioned that all
three vendors, obviously, we

559
00:30:11,250 --> 00:30:13,920
will make it the best experience
possible inside of our own

560
00:30:13,920 --> 00:30:16,290
clouds for all the different
services that you have. Same

561
00:30:16,290 --> 00:30:18,960
thing with AWS, same thing with
Google. It's just the strategy

562
00:30:18,960 --> 00:30:21,480
at all three players are doing,
we're the first one to go out

563
00:30:21,480 --> 00:30:24,540
and actually try to say, Okay,
well, the reality is customers

564
00:30:24,540 --> 00:30:26,850
are looking for this, we're
asking for this. So let's go off

565
00:30:26,850 --> 00:30:29,520
and give you an awesome
experience here inside of Azure,

566
00:30:29,760 --> 00:30:32,370
but then also give you the
insights from other places.

567
00:30:33,840 --> 00:30:35,640
Joey Snow: But it's the same
thing from a security

568
00:30:35,640 --> 00:30:37,740
perspective. And I hear this all
the time when I talk about Azure

569
00:30:37,740 --> 00:30:40,380
Active Directory, which then
tends to lead down the

570
00:30:40,380 --> 00:30:43,950
discussion of things like ATP
and some of the other the other

571
00:30:43,980 --> 00:30:46,590
security technologies that we
have, because we're kind of all

572
00:30:46,590 --> 00:30:48,990
together because that's how
we're sold right as part of BMS,

573
00:30:49,020 --> 00:30:55,380
right. But yes, there are multi
vendors out there that the one

574
00:30:55,470 --> 00:30:59,970
advantage that I see inside
ourselves is the sheer volume of

575
00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:04,350
of information and signals that
we have, where we're getting

576
00:31:04,350 --> 00:31:08,160
them from our ability to take
action on those signals. And

577
00:31:08,160 --> 00:31:13,140
then even more importantly, how
inside all of our products, we

578
00:31:13,140 --> 00:31:16,290
all can share that signals data,
right? And we

579
00:31:16,290 --> 00:31:18,780
Warren du Toit: can all take the
same time as the new Microsoft,

580
00:31:18,780 --> 00:31:23,430
right? So if you have to look
from sort of when such a took

581
00:31:23,430 --> 00:31:28,890
over, and that everything
started getting open sourced,

582
00:31:29,010 --> 00:31:31,650
and there was more
collaboration, and they weren't

583
00:31:31,650 --> 00:31:36,420
these big walls anymore. You can
see that Microsoft now is

584
00:31:36,420 --> 00:31:40,680
probably the number one
integrator of other products

585
00:31:40,710 --> 00:31:44,640
into their product, if you look
at it holistically, there are

586
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:48,840
API's to do so many things there
are I mean, if you look at the

587
00:31:48,840 --> 00:31:52,620
graph framework, yeah, you can
literally do whatever you want,

588
00:31:52,740 --> 00:31:56,610
and get any data out of it. And
then you can present it in a in

589
00:31:56,670 --> 00:32:01,080
any way you want it to be and
you can do it securely. And

590
00:32:01,110 --> 00:32:05,520
there's like none of that you
have to stick with us anymore.

591
00:32:05,790 --> 00:32:08,340
What just choose it mix and
match one

592
00:32:08,340 --> 00:32:10,530
Joey Snow: of the biggest
workloads that we authenticate

593
00:32:10,530 --> 00:32:12,090
to is Google. Yeah.

594
00:32:14,550 --> 00:32:17,850
I mean, that's we share that we
share that all the time. I'd say

595
00:32:18,090 --> 00:32:21,210
it was probably in Alex's
presentation earlier this week.

596
00:32:21,270 --> 00:32:26,460
Yeah. And so yeah, 100% I
understand.

597
00:32:27,980 --> 00:32:29,300
Nicolas Blank: what's the
circumstance? They?

598
00:32:29,940 --> 00:32:31,440
Joey Snow: Well, they're
authenticating to Google

599
00:32:31,440 --> 00:32:32,100
applications.

600
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:33,950
Nicolas Blank: Yeah, I was gonna
say is it inbound from Google?

601
00:32:33,980 --> 00:32:35,210
Or is it oubound to Google?

602
00:32:35,250 --> 00:32:38,250
Joey Snow: So it's, it's an
Azure Active Directory identity

603
00:32:38,250 --> 00:32:41,880
is being used to access a Google
Google Docs or whatever happens

604
00:32:41,880 --> 00:32:46,230
to be because remember, and and,
and identity is that's a little

605
00:32:46,230 --> 00:32:49,500
bit tricky in terms of you
really don't want to have

606
00:32:49,650 --> 00:32:52,410
identities living in multiple
places you don't because that

607
00:32:52,410 --> 00:32:56,250
means there's more crappy
passwords locating and that's

608
00:32:56,250 --> 00:32:59,580
another thing that somebody has
to manage. His identity is the

609
00:32:59,580 --> 00:33:01,740
one thing that You have to, you
have to make sure that you've

610
00:33:01,740 --> 00:33:04,860
got it and it's secured. And
it's, it's protected. And you

611
00:33:04,860 --> 00:33:07,020
can manage it and you can cover
and against it was only one of

612
00:33:07,020 --> 00:33:10,500
them. Yeah. Well, that ideally,
yes,

613
00:33:10,620 --> 00:33:13,350
Warren du Toit: I do is anything
I can take away from ignite is

614
00:33:13,350 --> 00:33:15,360
how I can fix that problem that
I'm having.

615
00:33:15,840 --> 00:33:19,860
Joey Snow: But listen, we were
very clear about our intention

616
00:33:19,860 --> 00:33:24,000
moving forward. We want to take
identity out of the hands of

617
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:26,340
companies and businesses and
everybody else and bring it back

618
00:33:26,340 --> 00:33:30,390
to the individual. That's,
that's our future vision, right

619
00:33:30,390 --> 00:33:34,530
where the person can control
that identity and then give the

620
00:33:34,530 --> 00:33:40,440
ability for me to us that it's
explained then take it back. But

621
00:33:40,440 --> 00:33:44,340
that's, that's, that's where we
have to go. That's where we have

622
00:33:44,340 --> 00:33:49,680
to go. And And particularly,
just look, how many of us really

623
00:33:49,950 --> 00:33:54,570
don't think our data is out
there. Huh? Come on. You were

624
00:33:54,570 --> 00:33:57,750
talking on the way to the
airport here. They were PII on

625
00:33:57,750 --> 00:34:00,180
your phone than there is on
throughout your house. In any

626
00:34:00,180 --> 00:34:03,000
documentation? Yeah, we carry
these things around with us.

627
00:34:03,720 --> 00:34:06,900
Right We connect 10 secure Wi Fi
is and all the other bad

628
00:34:06,900 --> 00:34:07,800
behavior that we have

629
00:34:07,830 --> 00:34:09,600
Rick Claus: Bluetooth beacons.
And as you're walking through a

630
00:34:09,600 --> 00:34:11,580
mall, yeah, I don't know where
you are in the mall and what

631
00:34:11,580 --> 00:34:13,320
you're doing just by having a
Bluetooth stack on.

632
00:34:13,380 --> 00:34:16,110
Joey Snow: So I understand the
concern around vendor lock in.

633
00:34:16,110 --> 00:34:20,340
But at the same time, there are
benefits to leveraging services

634
00:34:21,060 --> 00:34:24,480
from a vendor that can have that
communication and share that

635
00:34:24,480 --> 00:34:28,890
data across and making that data
exposed to you so that you can

636
00:34:28,890 --> 00:34:34,050
take action or even better. Let
the AI do it. Yeah. I don't want

637
00:34:34,050 --> 00:34:37,080
to have to manage session risk.
That's ridiculous to me. I don't

638
00:34:37,080 --> 00:34:41,580
know what the best rule is for
when when a session is risky. Or

639
00:34:41,580 --> 00:34:42,120
when it user

640
00:34:42,120 --> 00:34:44,670
Rick Claus: What do you mean, I
can't log in here in Orlando and

641
00:34:44,670 --> 00:34:45,510
in Seattle,

642
00:34:45,720 --> 00:34:48,870
Joey Snow: within an hour each
other time possible travel

643
00:34:48,870 --> 00:34:53,520
scenario, or, hey, maybe I
didn't know that my username and

644
00:34:53,520 --> 00:34:56,220
password ended up in some breach
and I've not changed it and I'm

645
00:34:56,220 --> 00:34:59,280
a global admin. Yeah, you think
you might want to know about

646
00:34:59,280 --> 00:35:02,460
that and even better Just next
time go who's the right one? No,

647
00:35:02,460 --> 00:35:05,700
that's me because I've got a
second factor off. Yes. And now,

648
00:35:05,880 --> 00:35:09,810
Joey, let's reset your password.
Or in this case, you know, just

649
00:35:10,050 --> 00:35:12,480
MFA me because I'm pastoralists.
Yeah, yeah.

650
00:35:12,570 --> 00:35:16,470
Nicolas Blank: Oh, I'm just in
time you so you don't need to be

651
00:35:16,860 --> 00:35:19,530
a high risk person with global
admin that gets targeted.

652
00:35:19,710 --> 00:35:22,230
Joey Snow: Well, and that's
that's really the key piece is

653
00:35:22,230 --> 00:35:24,870
that you shouldn't be running
global admin anyone? Yep. You

654
00:35:24,870 --> 00:35:27,660
should only elevate when
necessary and and even even more

655
00:35:27,660 --> 00:35:29,970
importantly, we shouldn't be
requiring you to be global admin

656
00:35:29,970 --> 00:35:32,160
to do a lot of the things that
you have, which is why we're

657
00:35:32,160 --> 00:35:35,310
doing a lot of investment, a lot
of work where I was about to

658
00:35:35,310 --> 00:35:37,110
ask, because you know,

659
00:35:38,680 --> 00:35:40,450
Nicolas Blank: there's a bunch
of stuff in teams that you can't

660
00:35:40,450 --> 00:35:44,080
do with Justin time. Other
products. Yep, not quite there

661
00:35:44,080 --> 00:35:48,310
yet. But all of the second teams
is a very complicated beats

662
00:35:49,180 --> 00:35:53,140
fine, but then the guidance that
you see is I need this Roland

663
00:35:53,140 --> 00:35:57,010
teams and I need that rollin
teams and unless you and even if

664
00:35:57,010 --> 00:36:00,460
you just in time them and this
you then decided to Temporarily

665
00:36:00,460 --> 00:36:03,550
grant someone Global Admins
stuff still doesn't work. Right.

666
00:36:03,550 --> 00:36:06,970
So our back is not as
transparent as ubiquitous as we

667
00:36:06,970 --> 00:36:10,210
wanted yet. But what I'm hearing
from you is like,

668
00:36:11,010 --> 00:36:13,500
Joey Snow: Yeah, well, we've
been doing that we made

669
00:36:13,530 --> 00:36:16,350
significant investments in that.
We've made investments in that,

670
00:36:16,350 --> 00:36:18,480
that we've talked about here
with with some new reader roles

671
00:36:18,480 --> 00:36:22,260
that we've that we've announced
here. So we have to continue.

672
00:36:24,540 --> 00:36:27,060
The best way that I can explain
this is that we don't ship

673
00:36:27,060 --> 00:36:32,040
product anymore. I we don't ship
a new version of active

674
00:36:32,040 --> 00:36:34,470
directory where we haven't done
that in in years and years and

675
00:36:34,470 --> 00:36:37,560
years. Yeah, we are a service.
We enhance the service

676
00:36:37,560 --> 00:36:40,710
consistently. We have to go
faster. We have to do it faster,

677
00:36:40,710 --> 00:36:43,620
because we have to get to our
customers need it. Yeah. And

678
00:36:43,710 --> 00:36:47,940
that's a difficult thing for IT
professionals to kind of get

679
00:36:47,970 --> 00:36:50,970
their heads around because
either we're not fast enough or

680
00:36:50,970 --> 00:36:54,600
we're too bloody fast. But
that's where that that push and

681
00:36:54,600 --> 00:36:59,100
pull. We made changes because we
understood that we had to

682
00:36:59,100 --> 00:37:02,040
provide this path Way to do
hybrid identity?

683
00:37:02,400 --> 00:37:04,260
Warren du Toit: And where do you
draw the line of stability as

684
00:37:04,260 --> 00:37:05,910
well? Right? Well, and how

685
00:37:05,910 --> 00:37:08,130
Joey Snow: do we make it easier
for people to actually go

686
00:37:08,130 --> 00:37:12,120
password lists? And those are
things that we heard from our

687
00:37:12,120 --> 00:37:15,210
customers. They're like, Look,
this is soo bone who I worked

688
00:37:15,210 --> 00:37:18,030
for, says, when we did password
list Initially, it was like a

689
00:37:18,030 --> 00:37:21,180
moonshot. And our customers are
like, Yo, what are you guys

690
00:37:21,180 --> 00:37:24,000
doing? We're not like this.
Yeah, we're like this, we need

691
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:27,150
you to help us get there in this
manner. And we listened and we

692
00:37:27,150 --> 00:37:30,420
made those adjustments. So I
hundred percent hear you around

693
00:37:30,420 --> 00:37:33,840
that in our back and those kinds
of things. Just as a few years

694
00:37:33,840 --> 00:37:38,400
ago, you had to be global admin
to do everything. And that's not

695
00:37:38,400 --> 00:37:41,250
good behavior. We have to change
that behavior internally to and

696
00:37:41,250 --> 00:37:45,840
we work on that. It's not just,
hey, our customers are our

697
00:37:45,840 --> 00:37:48,780
Microsoft to Microsoft is our
customer to and we have to make

698
00:37:49,920 --> 00:37:52,620
Rick Claus: that the best part
is, as you mentioned, we don't

699
00:37:52,620 --> 00:37:56,910
ship product anymore. Its
services. I can't even not not

700
00:37:56,910 --> 00:37:59,280
from the men's side of the
design side as you brought up

701
00:37:59,280 --> 00:38:03,390
there. But even just From a user
side, opening up one of my apps

702
00:38:03,420 --> 00:38:09,240
be outlook Word, PowerPoint,
Excel flow tooling or Microsoft

703
00:38:09,240 --> 00:38:12,660
Teams like that. I always get a
little surprised in the morning

704
00:38:12,660 --> 00:38:14,700
and says, Oh, you've been
updated the latest version.

705
00:38:14,730 --> 00:38:17,940
Okay, great. What changed? What
can I find? as an end user?

706
00:38:17,940 --> 00:38:20,880
That's a geek and a tech person.
I love to go off and find all

707
00:38:20,880 --> 00:38:23,610
the new stuff that's possibly
there. People go off and find

708
00:38:23,610 --> 00:38:31,200
it. Yeah. Yeah. Although all
about stage not those are all

709
00:38:31,410 --> 00:38:33,120
the different people. Yeah. And
so you want to have that all

710
00:38:33,120 --> 00:38:36,870
over the place. But yeah, no,
teams of all. software products

711
00:38:36,870 --> 00:38:39,390
evolve, the stuff inside of
Azure evolves, there's no longer

712
00:38:39,390 --> 00:38:42,300
gas' anymore. makes it hard for
us to be able to talk about

713
00:38:42,300 --> 00:38:45,240
announcements because you know,
well that's been out for a while

714
00:38:45,240 --> 00:38:48,750
but it just went ga but really,
everyone's been using it for the

715
00:38:48,750 --> 00:38:52,050
last six months. So really is a
big hype anymore. Not so much

716
00:38:52,050 --> 00:38:55,260
so, so it's it's kind of fun to
see where that where that's

717
00:38:55,260 --> 00:38:57,480
going to continue to evolve and
how it changes us as

718
00:38:57,480 --> 00:38:58,230
technologists.

719
00:38:58,870 --> 00:39:02,200
Nicolas Blank: We are coming up
to the The top of the hour so,

720
00:39:02,230 --> 00:39:03,730
Rick Claus: and you've got a
session to deliver somewhere

721
00:39:06,360 --> 00:39:06,930
Joey Snow: in 20 minutes.

722
00:39:09,840 --> 00:39:12,450
Nicolas Blank: So let us ask
you, how would the like that?

723
00:39:12,540 --> 00:39:16,740
How would the two of you like to
be found on socials or dude? No,

724
00:39:16,740 --> 00:39:21,210
no, let's not assume everybody
knows who everybody is. So, let

725
00:39:21,210 --> 00:39:24,690
us show you how they would like
to be found. And then also ask

726
00:39:24,690 --> 00:39:31,350
you one of the ones you would
like to plug.

727
00:39:32,070 --> 00:39:34,200
Joey Snow: Yeah, sure. Y'all go
ahead

728
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:38,290
Rick Claus: and start so well.
From a social and fun and

729
00:39:38,290 --> 00:39:40,840
community perspective. You can
find us both online together

730
00:39:40,840 --> 00:39:43,540
because no one knows who is who
and what is what and switch and

731
00:39:43,540 --> 00:39:46,990
patch and patch and switch at
sign patches, which is where we

732
00:39:46,990 --> 00:39:49,570
normally happen to be on the
social community and the fun

733
00:39:49,570 --> 00:39:49,870
side.

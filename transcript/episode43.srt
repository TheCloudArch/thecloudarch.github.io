Chris Goosen: Hello and welcome
to another episode of the cloud

11
00:00:55,540 --> 00:01:00,100
architects podcast. Today we are
in New Zealand of all places.

12
00:01:00,850 --> 00:01:03,130
And I must say the weather out
here is significantly better

13
00:01:03,130 --> 00:01:06,520
than the weather in Sydney where
I've just come from. So I took

14
00:01:06,520 --> 00:01:08,650
the time took the opportunity
here to sit down and we're going

15
00:01:08,650 --> 00:01:11,890
to we're going to record and
talk a little bit about teams.

16
00:01:12,340 --> 00:01:15,370
We don't have on a nick today. I
think Nick is in Singapore

17
00:01:15,370 --> 00:01:18,250
somewhere. Not sure what
Warren's doing. But for those of

18
00:01:18,250 --> 00:01:22,600
you who love Warren's energy,
never fear. We have a guest who

19
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:25,900
runs at that level right here.
So I think we're gonna we're

20
00:01:25,900 --> 00:01:29,140
gonna make up for it today. So
excited to be sitting down with

21
00:01:29,140 --> 00:01:32,530
Paul and Andrew here to talk
about teams. Guys, you want to

22
00:01:32,530 --> 00:01:34,120
do a quick introduction poll
starting with you.

23
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:37,690
Paul Bloem: Yeah, absolutely. So
my name is Paul Bloem. I have

24
00:01:37,690 --> 00:01:40,780
been a MVP for the last, what is
going for six years now?

25
00:01:41,110 --> 00:01:45,760
Hopefully, seven soon. I look
after a team that has got sort

26
00:01:45,760 --> 00:01:48,910
of collaboration, teams, Skype
for Business, all the pretty

27
00:01:48,910 --> 00:01:51,280
stuff that gets connected to
that, but more importantly,

28
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:55,090
these days. I'm focused on
adoption on governance,

29
00:01:55,090 --> 00:01:56,860
compliance and that sort of
thing.

30
00:01:57,960 --> 00:01:58,620
Chris Goosen: Very nice.

31
00:01:58,710 --> 00:02:01,650
Andrew Morpeth: All right. My
name is Andrew. I'm also an MVP

32
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:06,360
been one also for about six
years I do believe. So I'm, I'm

33
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:09,720
an ex Skype for Business guy, I
suppose we'll still a little bit

34
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:13,080
of Skype for Business came from
the office communication server

35
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:15,480
day. So very much engrossed in
the enterprise voice stuff,

36
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:19,260
transitioning at the moment into
the Microsoft team's world with

37
00:02:19,260 --> 00:02:21,750
enterprise voice glasses on at
the moment, but sort of working

38
00:02:21,750 --> 00:02:23,850
on all the other stuff that
teams brings to the table.

39
00:02:24,599 --> 00:02:26,309
Chris Goosen: And it brings a
lot to the table. Right? I mean,

40
00:02:26,309 --> 00:02:29,699
I think there's been, it's been
the constant theme for for a

41
00:02:29,699 --> 00:02:32,069
couple of years, at least now,
there's been a lot of talk about

42
00:02:32,099 --> 00:02:35,039
teams and teams and teams that
and, you know, obviously, we

43
00:02:35,039 --> 00:02:37,739
just come from ignite a couple
three months ago now, can you

44
00:02:37,739 --> 00:02:41,189
believe it three months. And
there was a lot of announcements

45
00:02:41,189 --> 00:02:43,949
that ignite and I mean, have you
guys seen anything new since

46
00:02:43,949 --> 00:02:45,929
ignite that that kind of sticks
out to you?

47
00:02:46,439 --> 00:02:50,069
Paul Bloem: Yeah, my favorite.
new functionality is really the

48
00:02:50,069 --> 00:02:52,229
SharePoint view that you get
when you're looking at your

49
00:02:52,229 --> 00:02:55,859
folder structure within teams,
being able to look at the date

50
00:02:55,859 --> 00:02:59,069
and timestamps and being able to
change the views and create

51
00:02:59,069 --> 00:03:01,799
perhaps even my own view I
really liked it. It's Yeah,

52
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:03,930
Andrew Morpeth: it adds a bit of
complication, but I like it as

53
00:03:03,930 --> 00:03:06,900
well. I like that familiar view
that you get from SharePoint and

54
00:03:06,900 --> 00:03:10,080
there, but more buttons to get
used to, I suppose for some

55
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:12,210
users, but I think it's a
welcome addition.

56
00:03:12,479 --> 00:03:15,629
Chris Goosen: Okay. Well, very
nice. Yeah. I mean, there's I

57
00:03:15,629 --> 00:03:18,749
think just recently I saw the
there was the read receipts have

58
00:03:18,809 --> 00:03:21,509
kind of made its way as well
which is which is kind of fun

59
00:03:21,509 --> 00:03:25,559
because especially when you're
in a in a situation where you

60
00:03:25,559 --> 00:03:28,439
know, islands mode, you don't
always have to do it's gonna be

61
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:34,060
Andrew Morpeth: it could be seen
as Big Brother ish. It is

62
00:03:34,060 --> 00:03:36,820
configurable by policy but
again, I like it it's good to

63
00:03:36,820 --> 00:03:40,270
know when someone send your
message. And of course, the

64
00:03:40,270 --> 00:03:43,390
expectation should be sit that
the chat is an instant message,

65
00:03:43,390 --> 00:03:46,660
right? It's not It's not the
expectation is not instant

66
00:03:46,660 --> 00:03:50,200
anymore as it wasn't skype. And
sort of training that out of

67
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:53,440
people is a hard thing because
we still get those messages of

68
00:03:53,470 --> 00:03:58,630
you know, hi, and then they wait
for a response. Hi, back. And

69
00:03:58,660 --> 00:04:01,300
don't just get to the point and
check I'm not used to that

70
00:04:01,300 --> 00:04:04,150
persistent nature that teams
brings that skype never had.

71
00:04:04,319 --> 00:04:06,689
Chris Goosen: Yeah, yeah, that's
a good point. I think, you know,

72
00:04:06,899 --> 00:04:10,919
read receipts or in any form of
communication is always an

73
00:04:10,919 --> 00:04:14,759
interesting one, right? Because
like me personally, on my phone

74
00:04:14,999 --> 00:04:17,909
on iMessage, I don't have
receipts turned on. Yeah. So you

75
00:04:17,909 --> 00:04:20,519
know, you'll guess if I've read
it or not, but then when I use

76
00:04:20,519 --> 00:04:24,029
WhatsApp, because I use WhatsApp
a lot as well. I like, you know,

77
00:04:24,059 --> 00:04:26,609
the fact the fact that folks can
see that I've, you know, read it

78
00:04:26,639 --> 00:04:29,429
or not. And it helps me when I
can, you know, and I guess maybe

79
00:04:29,429 --> 00:04:32,159
it's just the different types of
people that communicate on

80
00:04:32,159 --> 00:04:34,229
iMessage versus on WhatsApp.
Yeah. Yeah, that's

81
00:04:34,230 --> 00:04:35,220
Andrew Morpeth: right. It
depends what you're trying to

82
00:04:35,220 --> 00:04:38,460
avoid, as far as messages, most
of your contact address list.

83
00:04:38,460 --> 00:04:38,610
And

84
00:04:40,470 --> 00:04:42,540
Paul Bloem: when I'm speaking to
users, I'm always talking about

85
00:04:42,660 --> 00:04:46,350
having some form of a social
contract. And that is just the

86
00:04:46,380 --> 00:04:49,530
nature in which we behave
together. Yeah. So if we know

87
00:04:49,530 --> 00:04:52,530
hey, if you've read a message
then and if I want a response,

88
00:04:52,530 --> 00:04:54,570
because that's a social
contract, then please do

89
00:04:54,570 --> 00:04:58,140
respond. Or whether we're
sharing files or whatever it is

90
00:04:58,140 --> 00:05:00,540
we're doing, there's sort of a
social agreement. As to how

91
00:05:00,540 --> 00:05:02,580
we'll be operating in their
team, and I think that's

92
00:05:02,580 --> 00:05:06,060
essential. Otherwise you do get
that. Hey, are you just ignoring

93
00:05:06,060 --> 00:05:07,020
me? And what's going on?

94
00:05:07,260 --> 00:05:10,950
Chris Goosen: Yep, yep. And it's
hard because sometimes you need

95
00:05:10,950 --> 00:05:14,730
to gather your thoughts on
something, right? And I like to

96
00:05:14,730 --> 00:05:18,330
me, I guess etiquette would
dictate that, like, Hey, give me

97
00:05:18,330 --> 00:05:20,280
a second or Hey, I'm looking
into that for you. I'll get back

98
00:05:20,280 --> 00:05:22,350
to you in a second, right? Just
to give someone a response so

99
00:05:22,350 --> 00:05:26,760
that they know you have
acknowledged the message. I find

100
00:05:26,760 --> 00:05:30,510
that that's something that
doesn't exist all that often in

101
00:05:30,510 --> 00:05:34,590
business anymore, right? There's
this I need this from you. Give

102
00:05:34,590 --> 00:05:35,160
it to me

103
00:05:35,190 --> 00:05:38,100
Andrew Morpeth: situation. And
now now thing everyone wants

104
00:05:38,100 --> 00:05:40,680
everything now these days. Yes,
what we're conditioned for, I

105
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:44,130
suppose. But, yeah, again, that
comes back to that social

106
00:05:44,130 --> 00:05:46,860
contract. Right. And that's why
the adoption piece is so

107
00:05:46,860 --> 00:05:50,700
important. And unfortunately, it
does get lifted out quite a bit.

108
00:05:50,730 --> 00:05:53,370
And I think that's probably
especially true maybe in our

109
00:05:53,370 --> 00:05:57,420
region, because we're a little
bit she'll be right. You know,

110
00:05:57,420 --> 00:06:00,000
the users will figure it out.
Let's spin the budget on

111
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:04,560
Technology, you know, the
message I've got is that we can

112
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:06,420
just turn it all on in the
cloud, we don't have service to

113
00:06:06,420 --> 00:06:10,020
deploy as fireless services cost
in that regard. So that should

114
00:06:10,020 --> 00:06:12,630
be transition to watering and
feeding your users and keeping

115
00:06:12,630 --> 00:06:14,700
them up to speed and making sure
they understand the tick,

116
00:06:14,700 --> 00:06:17,910
because it's changing so
quickly, that it's really hard

117
00:06:17,910 --> 00:06:21,450
for anyone to keep up with even
even myself, right. I mean, I

118
00:06:21,450 --> 00:06:23,820
can I struggle to keep up and
I'm dealing with a single

119
00:06:23,820 --> 00:06:24,300
product.

120
00:06:24,540 --> 00:06:26,880
Paul Bloem: Yeah, yeah. I
couldn't agree more. And

121
00:06:26,940 --> 00:06:29,760
unfortunately, organizations are
looking at the technology and

122
00:06:29,760 --> 00:06:32,790
going, we can deploy this at a
much cheaper cost. Let's save

123
00:06:32,790 --> 00:06:37,560
their budget. Yeah. But the real
challenge is that traditionally,

124
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:40,440
folks haven't measured success
in the way you would think they

125
00:06:40,440 --> 00:06:43,350
would. They'd measure success
based on does the technology

126
00:06:43,350 --> 00:06:47,040
work? Check. It works. Does it
do what it said on the label?

127
00:06:47,070 --> 00:06:49,980
Yes, yes. But what they never
measure is are people using it?

128
00:06:49,980 --> 00:06:53,460
Are they circumventing it? Yeah.
Is it actually being adopted and

129
00:06:53,460 --> 00:06:56,100
used? Are you actually getting
value for money for your

130
00:06:56,100 --> 00:06:58,770
investment? Yep. Or is it just a
white elephant you've just paid

131
00:06:58,770 --> 00:07:01,380
for an off the wall. You've
saved. So we've, you know,

132
00:07:01,380 --> 00:07:03,450
Chris Goosen: we've had some
great conversations on this show

133
00:07:03,450 --> 00:07:06,810
about adoption and the
difference between adoption and

134
00:07:06,810 --> 00:07:10,770
consumption, right? And why it's
really important to measure the

135
00:07:10,770 --> 00:07:14,010
value that comes out of adopting
something as opposed to, well,

136
00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:17,190
you know, we have someone log
into it once every six months,

137
00:07:17,190 --> 00:07:20,970
and so therefore, the license is
justified. So that's, I mean,

138
00:07:20,970 --> 00:07:24,780
it's interesting, and I think
it's a very, it can be a very

139
00:07:24,780 --> 00:07:28,740
deep topic of conversation just
by itself. But what are you guys

140
00:07:28,740 --> 00:07:32,160
seeing as far as team's
adoption, right? Because if you

141
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:34,320
listen to Microsoft and the
Microsoft message, right,

142
00:07:34,350 --> 00:07:36,960
obviously, there's a lot of
investment going on in teams,

143
00:07:37,050 --> 00:07:39,870
the team's product group are
doing a lot to promote and

144
00:07:39,870 --> 00:07:43,590
market the product. Are you
seeing people adopting?

145
00:07:43,710 --> 00:07:45,120
Andrew Morpeth: Yeah, hundred
percent. I mean, most of the

146
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:48,840
customers I think we touch have
already deployed teams to some

147
00:07:48,840 --> 00:07:52,980
capacity. So you know, Microsoft
wants seats turned on and that's

148
00:07:52,980 --> 00:07:55,530
what they're pushing, right. But
the most of the customers were

149
00:07:55,530 --> 00:07:57,870
saying they've already turned
the stuff on. They just need

150
00:07:57,870 --> 00:08:00,000
help to do bits. They don't
quite understand it in

151
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:03,990
enterprise voice is a key one,
because it is still reasonably

152
00:08:03,990 --> 00:08:07,440
technical. So that element we
get pulled into a lot, I guess

153
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:10,500
the SharePoint aspect of it and
the document management stuff is

154
00:08:10,830 --> 00:08:13,590
a complex problem a lot of
organizations have, they might

155
00:08:13,590 --> 00:08:16,950
have things in Dropbox and
various other storage solutions

156
00:08:16,950 --> 00:08:20,610
or partially or, you know, not
properly deployed SharePoint, I

157
00:08:20,610 --> 00:08:22,890
need help in that regard. Those
would be the two key things do

158
00:08:22,890 --> 00:08:23,130
you think?

159
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:24,660
Paul Bloem: Well? Yeah,
absolutely. Absolutely. We're

160
00:08:24,660 --> 00:08:27,390
seeing a lot of organizer
because we've got quite a long,

161
00:08:27,390 --> 00:08:30,540
rich history in the Skype for
business world. What we're

162
00:08:30,540 --> 00:08:32,220
seeing is a lot of
organizations, existing

163
00:08:32,220 --> 00:08:34,530
customers, and some new who are
going we're on Skype for

164
00:08:34,530 --> 00:08:37,800
Business want to go to teams.
And the challenge I'm seeing is

165
00:08:37,800 --> 00:08:40,530
I'm going to them and I'm going
well, if you want to go apples

166
00:08:40,530 --> 00:08:42,660
for apples, because that's what
they say to me. Can you show us

167
00:08:42,660 --> 00:08:45,480
compete and so you can't because
Skype is an apple, but teams is

168
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:47,880
a fruit salad. Yes, there's some
apple in there. Yeah, but

169
00:08:47,880 --> 00:08:51,360
there's a hell of a lot of other
stuff in there, you know. And so

170
00:08:51,420 --> 00:08:53,640
it's often my point of
reference, just trying to bring

171
00:08:53,640 --> 00:08:56,340
them on board and show them the
teams is actually a portal

172
00:08:56,340 --> 00:08:59,730
through which you access many
other things including a slice

173
00:08:59,730 --> 00:09:00,000
of Apple

174
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:03,210
Chris Goosen: Yep, fair enough.
That's very well said. I think

175
00:09:03,210 --> 00:09:04,530
we might use that future.

176
00:09:05,669 --> 00:09:07,259
Andrew Morpeth: I'm gonna adopt
that too. I've heard it many

177
00:09:07,259 --> 00:09:09,809
times but haven't adopted into
my own vocab yet.

178
00:09:10,110 --> 00:09:13,500
Chris Goosen: Do you think
there's a difference to or in

179
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:17,610
the way? adoption is happening
in like here in New Zealand or

180
00:09:17,610 --> 00:09:21,450
in the APAC region, for example
versus North American, the rest

181
00:09:21,450 --> 00:09:21,960
of the world?

182
00:09:23,100 --> 00:09:25,380
Paul Bloem: It's a it's a good
question. We don't have the

183
00:09:25,380 --> 00:09:27,690
visibility we have what's
happening elsewhere is through

184
00:09:27,690 --> 00:09:30,270
our, you know, our connection
through the MVP program and that

185
00:09:30,270 --> 00:09:33,120
sort of thing. What what I'm
seeing and I'm sure Andrew,

186
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:36,810
you're probably on the same
page. A lot of organizations is

187
00:09:36,810 --> 00:09:39,630
kind of two, two parts to it.
There are those who are really

188
00:09:39,630 --> 00:09:44,040
keen to jump in and get it done
and who are happy to see the

189
00:09:44,040 --> 00:09:47,190
limitations or see the
challenges and find ways around

190
00:09:47,190 --> 00:09:49,740
them. Because you've highlighted
them upfront and then there are

191
00:09:49,740 --> 00:09:52,770
others who go I'll just sit back
and hold until you tell me it's

192
00:09:52,770 --> 00:09:55,560
all good. And that's kind of the
two views when they're coming

193
00:09:55,560 --> 00:09:58,110
from sort of a Skype well then
they are including Andrew

194
00:09:58,110 --> 00:09:59,520
specialty enterprise voice

195
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,280
Andrew Morpeth: If I was to take
a guess I think it comes down to

196
00:10:02,280 --> 00:10:05,730
size of organization as to
whether and how much time that

197
00:10:05,730 --> 00:10:08,850
they'll spend on adoption. And
in the New Zealand region, I

198
00:10:08,850 --> 00:10:11,790
guess the the typical business
size is probably under 100

199
00:10:11,790 --> 00:10:14,850
seats, right, we get the odd,
you know, hundred 500 seats,

200
00:10:15,150 --> 00:10:18,960
thousand, you know, four or
5000s getting pretty big, you

201
00:10:18,960 --> 00:10:21,990
know, biggest company in this
entire country is about 35,000

202
00:10:21,990 --> 00:10:25,890
seats run. So I think it
probably comes down to that. So

203
00:10:26,040 --> 00:10:30,330
my expectation would be sort of
North America excetera a lot, a

204
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:33,210
lot more bigger companies, they
would probably spend a lot more

205
00:10:33,210 --> 00:10:36,480
money on that stuff. They got a
lot more people to address. How

206
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:38,910
did it get the information
across versus say, 100 seat

207
00:10:38,910 --> 00:10:42,360
organization, it's a lot easier
for the IT department to just do

208
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:44,400
that they kind of personally
know the users.

209
00:10:44,610 --> 00:10:47,070
Paul Bloem: You know, it's a bit
easier. Yeah. What we're having

210
00:10:47,070 --> 00:10:50,610
to come up with ways to
introduce adoption concepts and

211
00:10:50,610 --> 00:10:53,790
principles in bite sized chunks
getting back to my food analogy,

212
00:10:54,090 --> 00:10:56,850
because no one's got the funding
divvied up the whole bowl,

213
00:10:56,850 --> 00:10:59,220
right? Yep. So we've got to give
them a little spoon feed chunks

214
00:10:59,220 --> 00:11:00,300
as they need to I think

215
00:11:00,300 --> 00:11:02,370
Chris Goosen: that's absolutely
fascinating. I mean, I had not

216
00:11:02,370 --> 00:11:07,110
considered that that the market
size is, you know, the average

217
00:11:07,110 --> 00:11:10,080
company size is going to be
smaller. And so the way that you

218
00:11:10,860 --> 00:11:13,260
when you're in a smaller
business, there is more of a

219
00:11:13,260 --> 00:11:16,200
familiarity of you know, people
know each other people know the

220
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:19,560
IT people. And so I think you do
deal with training and adoption

221
00:11:19,560 --> 00:11:22,470
slightly differently to, you
know, when your hundred thousand

222
00:11:22,470 --> 00:11:25,110
seat company and the IT guy
doesn't know, you're just a

223
00:11:25,110 --> 00:11:29,340
name, or an email address to
them, right. They don't know

224
00:11:29,340 --> 00:11:30,480
each other. No one knows each
other.

225
00:11:30,539 --> 00:11:32,309
Paul Bloem: Yeah, absolutely.
And then, of course, when you're

226
00:11:32,309 --> 00:11:35,999
looking at the adoption, sort of
the, the portfolio of skills you

227
00:11:35,999 --> 00:11:39,089
need, you know, there's all
these different roles that when

228
00:11:39,089 --> 00:11:41,549
you look at the Microsoft
framework, there's all these

229
00:11:41,549 --> 00:11:44,189
different people you've got in
there. You come down to New

230
00:11:44,189 --> 00:11:49,229
Zealand, and what do you find?
Well, your admin are all things

231
00:11:49,229 --> 00:11:52,409
to all people within that space.
Yeah. And so you know, it is

232
00:11:52,409 --> 00:11:53,879
what it is, and you just got to
go with it.

233
00:11:54,179 --> 00:11:56,879
Chris Goosen: Yeah, fair enough.
And so, with that, I mean, I

234
00:11:56,879 --> 00:11:59,369
guess if we look at the types of
companies around here are you

235
00:11:59,369 --> 00:12:02,999
seeing One of the things we've
seen a lot of over the last six

236
00:12:02,999 --> 00:12:06,419
or seven months, maybe nine
months is tenant to tenant type

237
00:12:06,419 --> 00:12:10,619
migrations, m&a type situations,
right? And we had for a long

238
00:12:10,619 --> 00:12:13,919
time we, that process was pretty
well understood and was pretty

239
00:12:13,919 --> 00:12:18,239
well, we had it down. We knew,
with the workloads that most

240
00:12:18,239 --> 00:12:20,939
companies adopted, we could do
those types of projects pretty

241
00:12:20,939 --> 00:12:24,599
easily with some tool sets and
things like that. But with teams

242
00:12:24,599 --> 00:12:28,229
in the mix, and because of
people adopting teams, it's

243
00:12:28,229 --> 00:12:31,109
inevitable that every tenant now
has some form of team stuff.

244
00:12:31,109 --> 00:12:33,539
Right. And, you know, just
recently, I was working with a

245
00:12:33,539 --> 00:12:38,309
customer where they, you know,
they had kind of sold off a part

246
00:12:38,309 --> 00:12:42,329
of their business divested a
part of their business, and they

247
00:12:42,329 --> 00:12:46,229
had two and a half thousand
teams. And and the new business

248
00:12:46,229 --> 00:12:48,389
was only taking like 500 of
those two and a half thousand

249
00:12:48,389 --> 00:12:51,509
teams. And it became I mean, it
was, it was very interesting.

250
00:12:51,509 --> 00:12:57,479
Yeah, yeah, I got to know the
graph API. That's an I I

251
00:12:57,479 --> 00:13:01,289
probably would have ever wanted
to drop it. That project. But I

252
00:13:01,289 --> 00:13:05,219
mean, it was fun, though, but it
is very complex.

253
00:13:05,309 --> 00:13:07,949
Paul Bloem: Yeah, that the tools
for that sort of tenant tenant

254
00:13:07,949 --> 00:13:11,549
migrations there. Yeah, I guess
I mean, they hardly existing.

255
00:13:11,549 --> 00:13:15,149
Right. They're they're pretty,
pretty juvenile at best. And so

256
00:13:15,149 --> 00:13:18,509
a lot of that comes down to the
skill sets of the resources

257
00:13:18,509 --> 00:13:19,139
using,

258
00:13:19,409 --> 00:13:21,239
Andrew Morpeth: and that can be
a creative challenge. And

259
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:24,810
Chris Goosen: it definitely, you
know, I think that the point

260
00:13:24,810 --> 00:13:27,960
there, or at least to me, is
it's arguable whether the

261
00:13:28,230 --> 00:13:31,620
investment in because let's be
honest, you can do anything. If

262
00:13:31,620 --> 00:13:34,290
you put your mind to it. We have
PowerShell we have automation

263
00:13:34,290 --> 00:13:36,540
things at the end, we can
eventually we can get there,

264
00:13:36,570 --> 00:13:39,150
right? Oh, you want to migrate
conversation history? Well,

265
00:13:39,150 --> 00:13:41,280
there's no real API for that,
but we could probably get it

266
00:13:41,280 --> 00:13:45,960
done. I know Lee Ford. MVP out
of the UK has a fantastic script

267
00:13:45,960 --> 00:13:50,820
and does some stuff. And you
know, I used his stuff a lot in

268
00:13:50,820 --> 00:13:54,270
the past or at least on that
project. I owe you a beer there

269
00:13:54,390 --> 00:13:57,600
Lee we'll see each other at
summit. I'm buying the first

270
00:13:57,600 --> 00:13:57,930
round.

271
00:13:58,350 --> 00:13:59,670
Andrew Morpeth: About a second
Yeah.

272
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,130
Chris Goosen: But you've got to
get to a point at some point

273
00:14:02,130 --> 00:14:05,040
where you go, well, the resource
costs associated with coming up

274
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:08,790
with these include g bomb Grant
Solutions isn't worth the reward

275
00:14:08,790 --> 00:14:10,740
of Yeah, getting the stuff.
Absolutely.

276
00:14:10,769 --> 00:14:13,469
Paul Bloem: You've got to, and
we had a discussion about that

277
00:14:13,469 --> 00:14:16,619
earlier today. Sometimes you've
got the sort of idea of

278
00:14:16,619 --> 00:14:20,069
perfection on a plan of where
you got to go. And then there's

279
00:14:20,069 --> 00:14:22,919
the budget. Yep. So you got to
kind of draw a line in the sand

280
00:14:22,919 --> 00:14:25,739
and go, look, we can give you
that perfect outcome that you

281
00:14:25,739 --> 00:14:29,129
want, but it's gonna cost you a
hell of a lot of money. So what

282
00:14:29,129 --> 00:14:32,189
are you comfortable with paying?
Yeah, how much can we deliver

283
00:14:32,189 --> 00:14:35,519
for that? And you've got to set
that expectation right from the

284
00:14:35,519 --> 00:14:38,009
beginning. And it gives you a
bit of leeway to deliver

285
00:14:38,009 --> 00:14:38,549
accordingly.

286
00:14:38,580 --> 00:14:40,950
Chris Goosen: Yeah. And I think
that's, that's the important

287
00:14:40,950 --> 00:14:43,680
part. That's our job as
technologists, right, is to be

288
00:14:44,400 --> 00:14:47,130
upfront with our customers and
actually advise them to that,

289
00:14:47,130 --> 00:14:51,750
right. I think Unfortunately,
there's this sort of sense

290
00:14:51,780 --> 00:14:54,720
lately of people just becoming
button clickers, right, instead

291
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:58,560
of actually being advisors or
consultants to to the customers

292
00:14:58,560 --> 00:15:01,140
because you know, it's so much
cheaper to do it. Project 100%

293
00:15:01,140 --> 00:15:03,360
remote that it is yeah, to go
and stand there talking to your

294
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:05,400
customer. But when you're
actually spending the time with

295
00:15:05,400 --> 00:15:07,320
them, you can actually then have
types these types of

296
00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:10,020
conversations and actually
deliver significant more value

297
00:15:10,020 --> 00:15:12,300
than just Next. Next Next thing
through that

298
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:15,510
Andrew Morpeth: person is so
important. Yeah, video

299
00:15:15,510 --> 00:15:19,050
conferencing to a degree. Yeah.
You need to get to know people

300
00:15:19,050 --> 00:15:21,660
and have candid conversations.
And yeah, at least initially,

301
00:15:21,660 --> 00:15:23,490
you need to have those in
person, I still think there's

302
00:15:23,490 --> 00:15:24,300
still merit in that.

303
00:15:24,450 --> 00:15:26,790
Paul Bloem: We're still old
school that way within our team.

304
00:15:27,630 --> 00:15:32,190
Any project that we kick off, we
always insist on you know,

305
00:15:32,190 --> 00:15:36,270
initially at very least getting
them eye to eye contact. Our

306
00:15:36,300 --> 00:15:40,380
body language, customer's body
language, you basically install

307
00:15:40,380 --> 00:15:43,500
confidence, and you help them to
appreciate that, hey, these guys

308
00:15:43,500 --> 00:15:46,380
know what they're doing and
they're here to help me. And of

309
00:15:46,380 --> 00:15:48,750
course between Andrew and I were
always waiting for that first

310
00:15:48,750 --> 00:15:50,370
project in Fiji but it hasn't
happened

311
00:15:52,110 --> 00:15:53,940
Andrew Morpeth: yet, or any
other island nation.

312
00:15:55,520 --> 00:15:59,660
Chris Goosen: So tell me about
and I think you might be the

313
00:15:59,660 --> 00:16:02,150
best Andrew might be the most
positive sort of work. So the

314
00:16:02,150 --> 00:16:06,110
islands mode trap is something
that I've, we've seen a lot of

315
00:16:06,179 --> 00:16:10,019
Andrew Morpeth: Yep. Yeah, I've
heard that term I coined I

316
00:16:10,019 --> 00:16:12,779
haven't quite used it myself,
but it's certainly a problem.

317
00:16:13,859 --> 00:16:17,669
You know, Microsoft obviously
want adoption of teams. And for

318
00:16:17,669 --> 00:16:22,199
them islands makes sense because
it means by default, generally

319
00:16:22,199 --> 00:16:24,239
speaking, if you're a three,
five, you know, one of those

320
00:16:24,239 --> 00:16:26,399
plans you get, it's going to
just be turned on unless the

321
00:16:26,399 --> 00:16:28,979
admins have done something to
circumvent that, right. You just

322
00:16:28,979 --> 00:16:32,549
get it. So if someone starts
using it, since an IM chat, I

323
00:16:32,549 --> 00:16:36,089
should call up to someone or
some sort of message, it will

324
00:16:36,089 --> 00:16:38,909
get to the other participant and
they can kind of join and it's

325
00:16:38,909 --> 00:16:44,639
there. The problem I find with
it is it causes interrupt issues

326
00:16:44,639 --> 00:16:47,609
because in Ireland's as the name
suggests, both Skype for

327
00:16:47,609 --> 00:16:51,269
Business if you're using that as
very separate teams and they run

328
00:16:51,269 --> 00:16:54,659
independently of each other. And
with Ireland's being the

329
00:16:54,659 --> 00:16:57,599
default. You really need your
customers to understand that

330
00:16:57,599 --> 00:17:00,359
they need to drive adoption away
from Skype entities. teams and

331
00:17:00,359 --> 00:17:02,879
make sure everyone's aware of
it. Because things that can

332
00:17:02,879 --> 00:17:06,419
happen. For example, as I seen
Paul a chat message, right? He

333
00:17:06,419 --> 00:17:08,399
doesn't know what teams is he's
never used it because his

334
00:17:08,399 --> 00:17:11,069
company hasn't announced that it
exists. It's just turned on. And

335
00:17:11,069 --> 00:17:13,769
he's found it. I found it. And
I've sent him a chat message.

336
00:17:14,369 --> 00:17:16,499
Yes, he'll get an email
notification, say someone's

337
00:17:16,499 --> 00:17:18,929
trying to get you in teams. But
he's never heard of his Oh, was

338
00:17:18,929 --> 00:17:21,209
this team's thing throws it in
this junk email, right. So

339
00:17:21,209 --> 00:17:25,079
creates a poor experience for
the users that who are using it.

340
00:17:25,079 --> 00:17:29,399
And the ones because of the ones
that aren't interested in kind

341
00:17:29,399 --> 00:17:32,369
of self learning it. So that's
where the problem is. So what

342
00:17:32,369 --> 00:17:35,579
you really want in my view, is
you want to make a call up

343
00:17:35,579 --> 00:17:38,819
front, you want to decide what
platform you're going to use,

344
00:17:39,089 --> 00:17:42,599
and sit that mode accordingly.
For one by doing that, it

345
00:17:42,599 --> 00:17:45,989
ensures that the interrupt
works. We get a lot of customers

346
00:17:45,989 --> 00:17:49,829
saying it doesn't work. And it's
not that it doesn't work. It's

347
00:17:49,829 --> 00:17:52,409
that probably you're in islands
mode, or probably you don't

348
00:17:52,409 --> 00:17:56,339
quite understand what the modes
actually mean. So in the very

349
00:17:56,339 --> 00:18:01,199
basic sense of it, there's a
Skype only mode which centrally,

350
00:18:01,229 --> 00:18:04,349
your teams is disabled, and you
only use Skype. And then at the

351
00:18:04,349 --> 00:18:06,809
other end of the scale, there's
a team's only mode where you

352
00:18:06,809 --> 00:18:10,589
don't use Skype anymore. And you
you fully transition to teams.

353
00:18:10,799 --> 00:18:13,529
There's modes in the middle that
let you transition features

354
00:18:13,529 --> 00:18:16,499
across, for example, there's a
Skype with teams meeting mode,

355
00:18:16,979 --> 00:18:19,409
right. And those modes
essentially will allow you to

356
00:18:19,409 --> 00:18:23,579
present to the user what they
should be using and what client

357
00:18:23,909 --> 00:18:27,119
and if you have half your user
base on Skype, and half on

358
00:18:27,119 --> 00:18:30,569
teams, it guarantees the
interrupt based on the modes

359
00:18:30,569 --> 00:18:34,739
that each of your users are on.
So if I'm in Skype, and I send a

360
00:18:34,739 --> 00:18:37,439
chat message to someone who is
in teams, I don't need to know

361
00:18:37,439 --> 00:18:40,109
that they're in teams. By
setting those policies correctly

362
00:18:40,109 --> 00:18:43,019
for each user. Microsoft will
make sure that that happens,

363
00:18:43,019 --> 00:18:46,019
right. And and largely this
works. This works well. And it

364
00:18:46,019 --> 00:18:51,119
works for even for Skype hybrid
server deployments. So yes, I

365
00:18:51,119 --> 00:18:54,029
think it probably is a trap.
That's probably not the best

366
00:18:54,029 --> 00:18:57,659
default. I understand why
Microsoft have done it. But

367
00:18:57,659 --> 00:19:00,419
it's, you know, it's up to you
IT admins out there, too. Get

368
00:19:00,419 --> 00:19:02,819
across it and make sure you
deploy the mode that suits you

369
00:19:02,819 --> 00:19:04,049
and understand what it means.

370
00:19:04,110 --> 00:19:06,360
Chris Goosen: Yeah, I think so.
But really bottom line here is

371
00:19:06,360 --> 00:19:10,020
it can be really confusing to
the end user when when email

372
00:19:10,110 --> 00:19:13,380
messages flying around. And
yeah, you know, and I saw this,

373
00:19:13,950 --> 00:19:17,190
you know, internally, we we
weren't on as much for a long

374
00:19:17,190 --> 00:19:21,180
time. And, you know, I was on
teams only because I was one of

375
00:19:21,180 --> 00:19:23,340
the tests guinea pigs, right.
But then like, my manager, for

376
00:19:23,340 --> 00:19:26,970
example, would not be and so I'm
trying to, I am aiming from

377
00:19:26,970 --> 00:19:31,440
teams, two teams, but you know,
his presence is away because

378
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:33,600
he's not even looking at the
team's client. He's using Skype

379
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:36,270
for everything. So I ended up
having two contacts for him one

380
00:19:36,270 --> 00:19:40,200
that has the Skype icon next to
it. One that doesn't it. Like

381
00:19:40,200 --> 00:19:42,480
for me, that's confusing. Can
you imagine for like an end user

382
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:44,040
who has no idea what's going on
here? It's

383
00:19:44,040 --> 00:19:46,770
Paul Bloem: a shame because the
technology we're talking about

384
00:19:46,770 --> 00:19:50,040
is designed to connect people.
Yes. Forget it. We're in a

385
00:19:50,040 --> 00:19:53,340
situation where we're
disconnecting. Yes, yeah.

386
00:19:53,430 --> 00:19:55,710
Chris Goosen: Yeah. So I think
really important to spend the

387
00:19:55,710 --> 00:20:00,000
time here thinking about not
only like, how will you want

388
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,730
What the best user experience is
going to be for your situation.

389
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:07,320
But also, make sure the timeline
is understood because it can be

390
00:20:07,320 --> 00:20:12,450
very easy trap to fall into
forgive the pun, to, okay, we're

391
00:20:12,450 --> 00:20:15,000
going to enable this, it's going
to coexist. So we don't need to

392
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:17,850
worry about accelerating the
deployment, because, hey, it's

393
00:20:17,850 --> 00:20:20,310
going to work right. You know,
it's kind of like a, like a

394
00:20:20,310 --> 00:20:22,740
hybrid deployment. You know,
there are a lot of folks in the

395
00:20:22,740 --> 00:20:26,460
exchange water use hybrid as a
long term coexistence mode,

396
00:20:26,460 --> 00:20:29,760
right, which is, which is fine
and in, it certainly works for

397
00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:32,010
that. But you don't want to be
doing that with this. You kind

398
00:20:32,010 --> 00:20:34,950
of want to use it to make sure
that you're transitioning

399
00:20:34,950 --> 00:20:37,440
correctly, but get the
transaction done as quickly as

400
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:37,860
you can. Yeah,

401
00:20:37,860 --> 00:20:38,730
Paul Bloem: it's got to be a
driver.

402
00:20:38,760 --> 00:20:40,350
Andrew Morpeth: Yeah,
absolutely. Yeah. Once customers

403
00:20:40,380 --> 00:20:43,560
understand what it means it's
actually a reasonably easy

404
00:20:43,560 --> 00:20:46,350
decision to take to the business
and say, Look, we need to make

405
00:20:46,350 --> 00:20:50,430
this decision, what's it going
to be? And then what I mean, the

406
00:20:50,430 --> 00:20:53,790
easiest thing to do and if
people had people have done that

407
00:20:53,880 --> 00:20:57,780
out the out front, right, or if
Microsoft had made Skype only

408
00:20:57,780 --> 00:21:00,720
the default because everyone was
on Skype or You know, something

409
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:03,150
like that. And then he forced
the admins to make the decision,

410
00:21:03,210 --> 00:21:06,810
it probably would have created a
bitter experience, because

411
00:21:06,810 --> 00:21:09,030
people would have had to go and
turn things on and really

412
00:21:09,030 --> 00:21:12,180
understand what it meant. And I
personally don't like the

413
00:21:12,180 --> 00:21:12,990
default. But

414
00:21:13,350 --> 00:21:16,590
Paul Bloem: yeah, I'll back you
up on that. I totally agree. I

415
00:21:16,590 --> 00:21:20,010
don't like the idea of having
dual apps with overlapping

416
00:21:20,010 --> 00:21:24,030
features. It confuses people.
But as soon as you change those

417
00:21:24,030 --> 00:21:27,480
modes to something else, you're
taking something away and if you

418
00:21:27,480 --> 00:21:30,300
ever want to annoy users take
something away so it leaves you

419
00:21:30,300 --> 00:21:32,730
in a in a nasty place which I
guess is a good thing for us

420
00:21:32,730 --> 00:21:34,140
since it's how we make our bread

421
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:37,080
Andrew Morpeth: well one thing I
find amusing is that that is

422
00:21:37,080 --> 00:21:40,530
completely the opposite in the
personal world, like people run

423
00:21:40,530 --> 00:21:43,350
around with WhatsApp iMessage
everything on their phones they

424
00:21:43,350 --> 00:21:46,050
got no problem switching between
them for you know different

425
00:21:46,050 --> 00:21:48,870
chats but when it comes to
enterprise Yep, it kind of has

426
00:21:48,870 --> 00:21:52,620
to be run by the business that
you work for otherwise they

427
00:21:52,680 --> 00:21:54,420
disinterested in it for what are

428
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,850
Chris Goosen: we also we're at a
point now where things are so

429
00:21:57,360 --> 00:22:01,440
like the always on on by default
is Such a thing now, right? Like

430
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:04,830
if you I think the the team's
app is now being deployed with,

431
00:22:05,070 --> 00:22:08,100
with Office. Yeah. So to kind of
get away from it, and you know,

432
00:22:08,100 --> 00:22:13,350
I, my wife, I often use my
wife's company organization as a

433
00:22:13,350 --> 00:22:17,880
great kind of example of a lot
of things because they, you

434
00:22:17,880 --> 00:22:21,330
know, they use the whole gamut
of technologies. They use

435
00:22:21,330 --> 00:22:24,090
Google, they use WebEx stuff.
And I know the other day, I was

436
00:22:24,090 --> 00:22:25,890
looking at a laptop for
something, I was helping you out

437
00:22:25,890 --> 00:22:28,620
with something. And I was like,
Hey, you have teams, and she was

438
00:22:28,620 --> 00:22:30,300
like, oh, let's just got
installed the other day. I don't

439
00:22:30,300 --> 00:22:36,120
know what that's for. Yeah,
exactly. So it's kind of just,

440
00:22:36,120 --> 00:22:39,270
uh, you know, you, you just, I
mean, it's a great example of

441
00:22:39,300 --> 00:22:41,490
actually being able to, you
know, communicate to your users

442
00:22:41,490 --> 00:22:44,850
when changes coming. But also,
there's so much overlap between

443
00:22:44,850 --> 00:22:47,490
so many different things and
different vendors are doing same

444
00:22:47,490 --> 00:22:50,370
things. And you know, why on
earth the WebEx folks called

445
00:22:50,370 --> 00:22:53,100
their product teams as well.
It's just beyond me like it

446
00:22:53,100 --> 00:22:53,400
just,

447
00:22:53,430 --> 00:22:54,870
Andrew Morpeth: you know, mix it
up some more.

448
00:22:55,590 --> 00:22:57,720
Chris Goosen: But let's not
scratch open that wound right

449
00:22:57,720 --> 00:23:03,090
now. So, okay, so let's, let's
talk a little bit about, I

450
00:23:03,090 --> 00:23:06,120
guess, direct routing and the
voice side of things.

451
00:23:06,510 --> 00:23:08,670
Andrew Morpeth: Okay. So for
those that don't know direct

452
00:23:08,670 --> 00:23:12,600
routing is essentially a bring
your own SIP trunk to Microsoft

453
00:23:12,600 --> 00:23:16,080
Teams. It's a it's an over the
internet encrypt encrypted SIP

454
00:23:16,080 --> 00:23:22,440
trunk between your session
border controller or SBC to the

455
00:23:22,440 --> 00:23:26,670
Microsoft Teams edge. There's
various ways you can deploy it.

456
00:23:26,670 --> 00:23:31,500
So you can use a supported or
certified SBC. So there's the

457
00:23:31,500 --> 00:23:34,650
likes of ribbon audiocodes. And
there's a few other ones Oracle

458
00:23:34,650 --> 00:23:37,800
and I'm trying to rattle them
off off the top of my head hear

459
00:23:38,430 --> 00:23:40,920
this, but the other way you can
do that is it's opened the doors

460
00:23:40,920 --> 00:23:44,040
for telcos to start offering the
service as well. So they're

461
00:23:44,040 --> 00:23:47,460
building out their SBC platforms
to support direct routing and

462
00:23:47,460 --> 00:23:51,330
then offering SIP trunks
directly to teams on your behalf

463
00:23:51,330 --> 00:23:54,690
right at little to no more
additional costs as what we're

464
00:23:54,690 --> 00:23:58,260
seeing in the market here. So
you know, it might be $1 $2 more

465
00:23:58,260 --> 00:24:01,740
for a SIP trunk as opposed to
Something delivered on premise

466
00:24:01,770 --> 00:24:04,320
that you'd have to hook up to
your own SBC. They take away the

467
00:24:04,320 --> 00:24:06,840
headache. And that makes sense
for a lot of customers who are

468
00:24:06,840 --> 00:24:08,910
trying to get everything off
Prem, move everything to cloud.

469
00:24:09,270 --> 00:24:11,760
They've already got a telco
relationship, that telco offers

470
00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:15,240
the service. They just turn it
on, migrate the numbers across,

471
00:24:15,690 --> 00:24:19,500
and you're done. There's still
some merit. I think in having an

472
00:24:19,500 --> 00:24:24,660
SBC. I like it. When customers
choose the SBC option selfishly

473
00:24:24,660 --> 00:24:28,860
probably because it gives me a
inbetween vantage point to see

474
00:24:28,860 --> 00:24:31,320
where things are going wrong if
they're going wrong. It also

475
00:24:31,320 --> 00:24:35,010
lets me do things like
manipulate numbers and and, you

476
00:24:35,010 --> 00:24:37,410
know, do some diverting and
different things like that

477
00:24:37,410 --> 00:24:41,280
that's not quite there in the
team's Admin Center at the

478
00:24:41,280 --> 00:24:44,220
moment or available as a
feature, right. So the SBC gives

479
00:24:44,220 --> 00:24:46,920
you some additional capability
that you wouldn't have if you go

480
00:24:46,920 --> 00:24:50,790
for a run of the mill hosted
solution. So those are the two

481
00:24:51,060 --> 00:24:53,370
options we have in our market
and there's obviously the

482
00:24:53,370 --> 00:24:56,430
Microsoft calling plans, but
they're only in sort of 11 1213

483
00:24:56,430 --> 00:24:58,950
countries off the top of my
head. Were you just buying the

484
00:24:58,950 --> 00:25:01,110
minutes directly of Microsoft.

485
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:03,970
Chris Goosen: Yeah. How what
would you say would be the

486
00:25:03,970 --> 00:25:06,430
percentage of folks who
organizations who already have

487
00:25:06,430 --> 00:25:10,630
an SBC that that they just
essentially using what they have

488
00:25:10,630 --> 00:25:12,250
versus new purchases? Yeah,

489
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:15,990
Andrew Morpeth: a lot of our
customers because we've been

490
00:25:15,990 --> 00:25:19,140
just hitting the sand with Skype
for Business for so long so many

491
00:25:19,140 --> 00:25:22,860
years. You know, all the
customers we deal with a pretty

492
00:25:22,860 --> 00:25:26,580
well I'd say 95% of our Skype
customers are enterprise voice

493
00:25:26,580 --> 00:25:30,840
enabled which means they have
SBCs a lot of those SBCs have

494
00:25:30,840 --> 00:25:33,240
always been Microsoft Certified
so therefore they can be

495
00:25:33,240 --> 00:25:36,960
firmware upgraded to support the
team's journey. So yeah, most of

496
00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:41,550
our customers who have Scott
definitely will have an SBC if

497
00:25:41,550 --> 00:25:43,530
they don't, you know, you can
buy one you can go for the

498
00:25:43,530 --> 00:25:46,800
hosted service. These are all
supported virtualized now. So

499
00:25:46,830 --> 00:25:50,220
you know, you can get pick one
up for a few hundred bucks. It's

500
00:25:50,220 --> 00:25:54,270
a reasonably cheap entry point.
Yeah. If you want to host it. We

501
00:25:54,270 --> 00:25:54,330
have

502
00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:57,030
Paul Bloem: we have a split with
several organizations and

503
00:25:57,030 --> 00:25:59,370
there's a number I'm working
with at the moment who are

504
00:25:59,370 --> 00:26:02,640
trying to be resilient
geographically to, you know,

505
00:26:02,940 --> 00:26:05,700
disasters and that sort of
thing. But a lot of them have

506
00:26:05,700 --> 00:26:08,940
components that don't
traditionally work with sort of

507
00:26:08,940 --> 00:26:11,880
a hosted or cloud based SBC so
that they might have some

508
00:26:11,910 --> 00:26:15,750
elevator phones, they might have
some Nish contact center that

509
00:26:15,750 --> 00:26:19,260
doesn't talk to teams. And so
we'll use the session border

510
00:26:19,260 --> 00:26:22,530
controller as a voice gateway or
router, right, that allows you

511
00:26:22,530 --> 00:26:26,940
to intercept and interoperate
these different platforms. fair

512
00:26:26,940 --> 00:26:30,930
to say those are massively more
complex in terms of deployment,

513
00:26:31,140 --> 00:26:33,900
and looking after and so on. And
that I guess it's fair to say

514
00:26:33,900 --> 00:26:37,320
that's our Kung Fu, we may get
some good margin of that. We

515
00:26:37,320 --> 00:26:41,850
know that space very well. And
those who have gone down that

516
00:26:41,850 --> 00:26:45,210
path have made their choice
knowingly because of

517
00:26:45,210 --> 00:26:47,970
constraints, functions,
features, that sort of thing

518
00:26:47,970 --> 00:26:50,280
that's not available in the
Skype or even team's world.

519
00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:52,880
Andrew Morpeth: Yeah, that's
right. But the key the key

520
00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:56,240
things we use SBCs for if we
have access to them ourselves,

521
00:26:56,750 --> 00:26:59,900
number one, and ELA and
allocated numbers. There's no

522
00:26:59,900 --> 00:27:03,230
reason way to handle that in
teams right now. So in the SBC,

523
00:27:03,230 --> 00:27:06,110
I can I can see that teams
doesn't know what that number

524
00:27:06,110 --> 00:27:09,260
is. And then I can basically do
a reroute and maybe rewrite that

525
00:27:09,260 --> 00:27:11,720
as the reception queue or
something like that and send the

526
00:27:11,720 --> 00:27:14,960
number elsewhere. It's probably
one of the key things that we

527
00:27:14,960 --> 00:27:18,230
use it for. And also just
general number manipulations,

528
00:27:18,230 --> 00:27:21,020
which, as far as I can tell,
I've seen, I've seen some stuff

529
00:27:21,020 --> 00:27:26,540
surface in the PowerShell.
Properties, but I don't believe

530
00:27:26,540 --> 00:27:30,020
they're accessible to be seen
just yet. But there are some

531
00:27:30,020 --> 00:27:32,990
translation capabilities that I
think are going to be surfaced

532
00:27:32,990 --> 00:27:36,500
in teams soon. So that will
negate some of us. But that's

533
00:27:36,500 --> 00:27:40,610
probably the key thing that we
enjoy having an SBC for, on top

534
00:27:40,610 --> 00:27:43,580
of bit, the trace, the
traceability being able to see

535
00:27:43,580 --> 00:27:46,520
what what is Microsoft saying,
what are the telco say? Yep. And

536
00:27:46,520 --> 00:27:50,060
where should I focus my efforts
to find the problem versus don't

537
00:27:50,060 --> 00:27:53,420
have an SBC I need to look in
the Microsoft portal, try and

538
00:27:53,450 --> 00:27:56,630
gather as much information I can
from the logging, which is not

539
00:27:56,630 --> 00:28:00,500
as detailed as traces and go
from there. And then Maybe I've

540
00:28:00,500 --> 00:28:02,960
got to engage the telco because
its their problem so, it takes a

541
00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:06,830
little bit longer yes on an SBC
trace, we can figure out exactly

542
00:28:06,830 --> 00:28:08,720
what's going on straightaway.
Yeah,

543
00:28:08,900 --> 00:28:12,050
Chris Goosen: I can see how that
would be beneficial and how

544
00:28:12,230 --> 00:28:14,720
potentially having some third
party doing the sort of cloud

545
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:18,980
SBC situation would would cause
a situation of people pointing

546
00:28:18,980 --> 00:28:22,160
fingers at each other, right?
Yeah. But then but then you also

547
00:28:22,160 --> 00:28:23,750
have a few you know, if you
really want to keep it very

548
00:28:23,750 --> 00:28:26,180
simple and you potentially a
smaller organization, you could

549
00:28:26,180 --> 00:28:28,880
just buy the minutes if you're
in a supportive market, you

550
00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:31,310
could just buy the minutes from
Microsoft and distribute it all.

551
00:28:31,370 --> 00:28:33,680
Then you have the one throat to
choke as they say, Well, yeah,

552
00:28:33,680 --> 00:28:35,870
it's all Microsoft Microsoft
thing that exact Okay,

553
00:28:36,240 --> 00:28:37,860
Andrew Morpeth: so there's
plenty options. It just comes

554
00:28:37,860 --> 00:28:40,290
down to your your preference,
okay, we just normally talk it

555
00:28:40,290 --> 00:28:42,870
through with the customer.
totally up to them. We don't we

556
00:28:42,870 --> 00:28:46,170
don't push any particular way of
doing it down their throat. It's

557
00:28:46,170 --> 00:28:46,470
Yeah, we

558
00:28:46,470 --> 00:28:50,130
Paul Bloem: don't we don't have
a preferred service or anything

559
00:28:50,130 --> 00:28:53,340
like it will be. We basically go
pros and cons. What's the

560
00:28:53,340 --> 00:28:56,520
customer's current relationships
with with whoever they're

561
00:28:56,520 --> 00:28:59,100
dealing with, and then we try
and work with them to find some

562
00:28:59,100 --> 00:28:59,790
short yet

563
00:29:00,570 --> 00:29:02,730
Chris Goosen: And how about I
mean, are you seeing a lot of

564
00:29:02,730 --> 00:29:06,570
customers replacing their
traditional PBX systems with

565
00:29:06,600 --> 00:29:09,210
with teams? And do you think
teams is ready for that? Is it

566
00:29:09,210 --> 00:29:09,390
really?

567
00:29:11,700 --> 00:29:15,870
Andrew Morpeth: It's a hard one
to answer. It's not quite there.

568
00:29:15,900 --> 00:29:19,080
Really. It's at the tipping
point, I think so where it will

569
00:29:19,080 --> 00:29:22,020
suit a customer as well. You've
got simple requirements. Okay.

570
00:29:22,020 --> 00:29:24,990
So we're we're mostly seeing
people take the plunge to

571
00:29:24,990 --> 00:29:29,430
enterprise voice and teams, is
professional services type

572
00:29:29,430 --> 00:29:31,890
industries, because they don't
have super complex requirements.

573
00:29:31,890 --> 00:29:35,580
This generally people like us,
lawyers, accountants, those

574
00:29:35,580 --> 00:29:38,580
sorts of people who are making
and receiving calls directly to

575
00:29:38,580 --> 00:29:42,630
them. And they might have a
receptionist or to receptionist

576
00:29:42,630 --> 00:29:45,480
or something like that simple
call flow coming in, distributes

577
00:29:45,480 --> 00:29:48,270
calls, that that works pretty
well. But there's still

578
00:29:48,300 --> 00:29:52,440
limitations even in that right.
The call queues are getting

579
00:29:52,440 --> 00:29:54,840
pretty good. Some of the
features of the call queues

580
00:29:55,230 --> 00:29:58,890
getting better than Skype, some
aren't quite as mature. The

581
00:29:58,890 --> 00:30:01,740
biggest ones that we come up
against that a well worth noting

582
00:30:01,770 --> 00:30:06,090
is, by default from a queue, you
can't fold out to a PSTN number,

583
00:30:06,120 --> 00:30:08,670
you know, it's quite a common
requirement, maybe an uncle tick

584
00:30:08,670 --> 00:30:11,340
or something you need to go
directly out. So, workaround,

585
00:30:11,340 --> 00:30:14,340
you need a dummy user account
that's fully licensed, you know,

586
00:30:14,340 --> 00:30:18,450
so you kind of have to create
your own creative ways of doing

587
00:30:18,450 --> 00:30:23,010
things. Another one that we that
impacts us, I think it's more of

588
00:30:23,010 --> 00:30:26,760
an APAC issue. Not a global
issue from other people I've

589
00:30:26,760 --> 00:30:30,240
talked to is that there's
significant call queue delay. So

590
00:30:30,240 --> 00:30:34,140
when you answer a call queue
call, you can I've seen up to

591
00:30:34,170 --> 00:30:36,600
eight seconds before you get
audio right. Wow, that's a

592
00:30:36,600 --> 00:30:40,470
pretty disjointed experience for
the agent trying to answer calls

593
00:30:40,470 --> 00:30:42,540
right, where they're going to
sit there and wait for the the

594
00:30:42,540 --> 00:30:46,470
audio to kick in. So that's
problematic. And we've we've had

595
00:30:46,470 --> 00:30:48,990
to for some customers who don't
think that's acceptable, and I

596
00:30:48,990 --> 00:30:51,510
don't think that's acceptable
personally, some customers live

597
00:30:51,510 --> 00:30:53,370
with it. But for customers that
don't want to live with it,

598
00:30:53,370 --> 00:30:57,960
we've had to use again, dummy
user accounts using the core

599
00:30:57,960 --> 00:31:01,200
group capability of a user
endpoint tops it out, right? So

600
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:05,520
we create a core group in the
user config and distribute calls

601
00:31:05,520 --> 00:31:08,880
that way. Again, another
creative way of doing things to

602
00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:13,650
work around some immaturities in
the product. So, you know, if,

603
00:31:13,830 --> 00:31:16,140
if you're going to move
enterprise voice to teams, my

604
00:31:16,140 --> 00:31:19,740
general messages, you've got to
be willing to deal with some

605
00:31:19,740 --> 00:31:22,830
rough edges. I wouldn't call it
bleeding edge anymore, but it's

606
00:31:22,830 --> 00:31:25,620
kind of just come out of the
bleeding edge. And it's for the

607
00:31:25,620 --> 00:31:29,910
early majority, certainly who
are willing and able and

608
00:31:29,910 --> 00:31:34,590
prepared to be kind of flexible
and you know, working around how

609
00:31:34,590 --> 00:31:37,320
they might have expected it to
work versus the realities of it.

610
00:31:37,770 --> 00:31:41,610
So you really need to make sure
you understand how enterprise

611
00:31:41,610 --> 00:31:46,110
voice works and compare feature
for feature for you know, what

612
00:31:46,110 --> 00:31:48,180
you've got and what you've come
from and determine what you're

613
00:31:48,180 --> 00:31:51,300
prepared to give up them to get
to teams at this enterprise

614
00:31:51,300 --> 00:31:55,200
voice for at this early stage.
Yeah, but enterprise voice is

615
00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:57,870
not what Microsoft's really
pushing as a it's really the

616
00:31:57,870 --> 00:32:02,100
collaboration So that stuff's
gonna mature, they're moving it

617
00:32:02,100 --> 00:32:05,610
from the Skype online world it's
getting there. It's, it's, I've

618
00:32:05,610 --> 00:32:08,820
always said probably by the end
of this year, we'll probably be

619
00:32:08,820 --> 00:32:11,850
at the point where Man, these
features are actually probably

620
00:32:11,850 --> 00:32:15,030
better than Skype. Now a lot of
them are already kind of better.

621
00:32:15,180 --> 00:32:17,340
I like the auto attendance
better the text to speech,

622
00:32:17,340 --> 00:32:20,160
there's a lot of stuff that's
better is just some stuff that's

623
00:32:20,160 --> 00:32:21,390
just not quite there

624
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:23,520
Paul Bloem: It needs a bit of
time to mature. So a lot of

625
00:32:23,520 --> 00:32:26,460
businesses are not quite ready
to take the plant. They want to

626
00:32:26,460 --> 00:32:30,390
see it prove itself and you who
can blame them? Yeah. But for

627
00:32:30,390 --> 00:32:34,050
me, the real shining star in the
team space when you're coming

628
00:32:34,050 --> 00:32:37,800
from a Skype for business
background is the meeting space.

629
00:32:38,040 --> 00:32:40,740
I absolutely love the meeting
space. It's one of my favorite

630
00:32:40,740 --> 00:32:43,560
things to talk about it being
able to see and there's some

631
00:32:43,590 --> 00:32:46,740
really cool things coming that
just can't wait to get my hands

632
00:32:46,740 --> 00:32:51,930
on and just having a look at
Skype versus a team's meeting.

633
00:32:51,930 --> 00:32:53,670
It kind of feels a little 80s.
Yeah.

634
00:32:54,600 --> 00:32:57,060
Andrew Morpeth: I mean, yeah,
hasn't changed much past what it

635
00:32:57,060 --> 00:33:00,660
was a messenger you know, it's
all that same sort of format, it

636
00:33:00,660 --> 00:33:03,270
looks nice bit nicer. But it's
sort of that messenger. It's

637
00:33:03,270 --> 00:33:06,600
very old school instant message.
And I say, teams is definitely

638
00:33:06,600 --> 00:33:08,910
the new thing and the way
forward and just jumping back to

639
00:33:08,910 --> 00:33:12,270
modes, right? This is where you
can use Mosier advantage if

640
00:33:12,270 --> 00:33:14,460
you're a Skype customer and
you're an enterprise voice in

641
00:33:14,460 --> 00:33:17,220
teams isn't ready for you've
checked it out, you can still

642
00:33:17,220 --> 00:33:20,520
enable your users as Skype for
Business with teams

643
00:33:20,550 --> 00:33:23,940
collaboration and meetings. So
that lights up meetings and

644
00:33:23,940 --> 00:33:26,250
teams and you've got the
collaboration stuff, which Skype

645
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:30,000
arguably doesn't work that
either doesn't do and meetings,

646
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:32,850
probably not as good. You can
light that up in teams, but

647
00:33:32,850 --> 00:33:36,180
still ensure that the enterprise
voice features are still in

648
00:33:36,180 --> 00:33:38,940
teams. And so sorry. Yeah, yeah.

649
00:33:39,240 --> 00:33:42,000
Chris Goosen: Yeah, that's
actually a good point. Um, I you

650
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:46,260
know, I think we're seeing rapid
development on this though,

651
00:33:46,260 --> 00:33:48,390
right? It's not like Microsoft
were promising or making

652
00:33:48,390 --> 00:33:50,820
promises a year ago that they
still making today

653
00:33:50,840 --> 00:33:53,540
Andrew Morpeth: or we're still
delivering stuff. Yeah. Which

654
00:33:53,540 --> 00:33:58,520
which, but Skype didn't really
change too much over the last. I

655
00:33:58,520 --> 00:34:02,600
mean between 2013 and 20. 15
versions? I mean, yeah, there

656
00:34:02,600 --> 00:34:05,030
were a few sort of small
additions, but it hasn't

657
00:34:05,240 --> 00:34:08,600
fundamentally changed for quite
a long time. Whereas teams is

658
00:34:08,600 --> 00:34:11,630
new and exciting. And it's
certainly the way forward and

659
00:34:11,630 --> 00:34:15,200
and it's, I think meeting the
needs of the modern kind of

660
00:34:15,200 --> 00:34:20,510
information work a much better
than Skype does or ever will.

661
00:34:20,510 --> 00:34:26,060
Because, you know, Skype's, I
guess, at the start of at sunset

662
00:34:26,060 --> 00:34:29,030
and a lot of ways, right, it's
still a valid product, we still

663
00:34:29,030 --> 00:34:31,910
recommend it where it makes
sense. And the great thing about

664
00:34:31,910 --> 00:34:36,440
choosing Scott is that you have
a way to get to teams, it's you

665
00:34:36,440 --> 00:34:39,470
can have, you can still deploy
Skype and have some users on

666
00:34:39,470 --> 00:34:41,840
teams, you can have some of your
users using teams made, you

667
00:34:41,840 --> 00:34:44,300
know, you've got the best of
both worlds if you go that way.

668
00:34:44,750 --> 00:34:48,230
And yeah, still completely valid
solution, completely valid

669
00:34:48,230 --> 00:34:52,310
solution, but it is it's kind of
where the PBX was 15 years ago

670
00:34:52,310 --> 00:34:56,990
when Skype and these UC platform
started coming out. PB x's are

671
00:34:56,990 --> 00:34:59,990
still around, but they're sort
of kind of the almost did now.

672
00:34:59,990 --> 00:35:04,430
Right. Scott's gonna be around
for 510 years, I'd say, you

673
00:35:04,430 --> 00:35:06,650
know, before it disappears.

674
00:35:06,960 --> 00:35:09,300
Paul Bloem: Yeah, no, I
absolutely agree. It's been

675
00:35:09,300 --> 00:35:11,550
incredible. I come from a PBX
background, he used to work for

676
00:35:11,550 --> 00:35:16,560
Siemens, and the the mentality
there was delivering services in

677
00:35:16,560 --> 00:35:20,430
a way that they could address
what they perceive as problems,

678
00:35:20,460 --> 00:35:22,380
like, you know, pick up groups
and hunt groups and all this

679
00:35:22,380 --> 00:35:25,140
sort of thing. And I always say
that, you know, with Skype, and

680
00:35:25,140 --> 00:35:30,060
also with teams, the notion is
different. I always argue with,

681
00:35:30,090 --> 00:35:31,920
you know, when I'm doing
training sessions with users

682
00:35:31,920 --> 00:35:35,460
always tell them that when, when
I'm trying to reach you, who

683
00:35:35,460 --> 00:35:38,880
knows best how to get hold of
you, me, or you, will you do you

684
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:41,010
know, whether you're on the run
or whether you're at home or

685
00:35:41,010 --> 00:35:44,520
whether you're in a hotel, so I
shouldn't change my behavior of

686
00:35:44,520 --> 00:35:47,400
reaching you, you control how
that's delivered. And that's

687
00:35:47,400 --> 00:35:50,160
fundamentally how it's changed
the way people communicate. It's

688
00:35:50,160 --> 00:35:53,790
been brilliant. But the scary
bit is it's developing so fast,

689
00:35:53,790 --> 00:35:57,300
and that's scary, but it's also
very exciting. And very often,

690
00:35:57,300 --> 00:35:59,670
and we might have to take a time
check right now because this

691
00:35:59,670 --> 00:36:02,100
might be invalid by the time I
get to the end of the sentence,

692
00:36:02,790 --> 00:36:07,740
current state of features is
evolving so fast that sometimes

693
00:36:07,740 --> 00:36:10,410
I'm busy showing somebody
something and then I find that

694
00:36:10,410 --> 00:36:11,010
it's changed.

695
00:36:11,930 --> 00:36:13,820
Chris Goosen: Well, we will run
into that problem every now and

696
00:36:13,820 --> 00:36:16,130
then right away. The best is
when you're in the Admin Center

697
00:36:16,130 --> 00:36:18,230
trying to do a demo of something
that the customer has asked,

698
00:36:18,320 --> 00:36:21,290
then you can't find where it is.
You're like, I saw this was here

699
00:36:21,290 --> 00:36:24,260
just yesterday. And they're
like, yeah, sure, it was. Yeah.

700
00:36:25,370 --> 00:36:27,560
And this is because the UI moves
something just a little bit

701
00:36:27,560 --> 00:36:30,620
around. So that's it. I mean,
it's it's a problem. Right. But

702
00:36:30,830 --> 00:36:33,500
I guess it's part of the
challenge we have is just going

703
00:36:33,500 --> 00:36:38,090
to stay on top of that. And so I
mean, we, we talked about, I

704
00:36:38,090 --> 00:36:42,800
guess, teams being a fairly, you
know, fruit salad versus just an

705
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:45,830
apple. Right. But, I mean, I
guess one of the questions that

706
00:36:45,830 --> 00:36:47,690
a lot of folks probably
listening to this or watching

707
00:36:47,690 --> 00:36:51,260
this have is how is their
skillset relevant in the new

708
00:36:51,260 --> 00:36:54,680
teams world, right, because I
think, to me right now, there's

709
00:36:54,680 --> 00:36:58,100
no such thing as a team's SME
because teams is made up of so

710
00:36:58,100 --> 00:37:01,430
many different pieces, hit the
fruit salad That it depends on

711
00:37:01,430 --> 00:37:02,510
your background and where you
come from.

712
00:37:02,510 --> 00:37:05,900
Paul Bloem: Absolutely. It's,
it's at this early stage, there

713
00:37:05,930 --> 00:37:08,960
are not a lot of people on the
planet who have got a handle

714
00:37:09,140 --> 00:37:14,330
across, even 80% of the
underlying bits of technology.

715
00:37:14,330 --> 00:37:16,790
And, and we're finding that you
know, So traditionally coming

716
00:37:16,790 --> 00:37:19,280
from a voice background and
having lots of Skype for

717
00:37:19,280 --> 00:37:21,620
Business, and now transitioning
into the governance and

718
00:37:21,860 --> 00:37:26,030
compliance areas and all the
adoption stuff. When you look at

719
00:37:26,030 --> 00:37:30,050
that whole spectrum, you do need
different skill sets across so

720
00:37:30,050 --> 00:37:33,110
you there is you're dead, right?
There is no such thing as one

721
00:37:33,110 --> 00:37:36,200
person who knows it all. And and
we're finding that, you know,

722
00:37:36,200 --> 00:37:38,990
we've got some SharePoint guys
in the team, and I'm relying

723
00:37:38,990 --> 00:37:41,300
heavily on them, and they're
teaching me things all the time.

724
00:37:41,330 --> 00:37:45,290
Yep. And just getting a feel for
how they, you know, put things

725
00:37:45,290 --> 00:37:48,500
in place around governance,
compliance, and, you know,

726
00:37:48,500 --> 00:37:52,370
around all that sort of control,
but I'm learning lots, but what

727
00:37:52,370 --> 00:37:56,270
I'm finding is there's a lot
more consulting than actual

728
00:37:56,300 --> 00:37:58,250
pushing nerd knobs and buttons.

729
00:37:58,350 --> 00:37:59,520
Chris Goosen: Yes, yeah,

730
00:37:59,550 --> 00:38:02,070
Andrew Morpeth: yeah, it's Very
true. Yeah. I mean, I somewhat

731
00:38:02,070 --> 00:38:05,400
missed the Skype days where you
could be intimately familiar

732
00:38:05,400 --> 00:38:07,860
with a single platform and just
know everything about it.

733
00:38:08,070 --> 00:38:11,670
Because now in this world, you
cannot know everything about the

734
00:38:11,670 --> 00:38:14,940
entire stack. And teams is just
a window into multiple micro

735
00:38:14,940 --> 00:38:19,260
services in teams, I'd say to
sis admins, you've already got a

736
00:38:19,260 --> 00:38:22,440
whole ton of skills already that
you might not know you have.

737
00:38:22,680 --> 00:38:26,310
Because teams is leveraging
stuff you already know. It's

738
00:38:26,310 --> 00:38:30,510
just a window into that that
stuff, right? So yes, it is a

739
00:38:30,630 --> 00:38:32,850
collaboration focused product
and there's stuff to learn in

740
00:38:32,850 --> 00:38:35,820
that regard. But a lot of the
underlying technologies you

741
00:38:35,820 --> 00:38:36,930
probably familiar with

742
00:38:37,140 --> 00:38:41,940
Chris Goosen: it so my Sorry,
it's almost like it the the

743
00:38:41,940 --> 00:38:46,320
different areas or components of
it also make for different

744
00:38:46,320 --> 00:38:49,260
deployments. Right. So for
example, when you have a voice

745
00:38:49,740 --> 00:38:52,290
deployment, your voice
requirements, I guess, fairly

746
00:38:52,290 --> 00:38:54,930
binary in terms of customers are
going to know they have these

747
00:38:54,930 --> 00:38:57,660
phone numbers that need to be
answered in this way or handled

748
00:38:57,660 --> 00:39:00,000
in this way. But when it comes
to the compliance and the

749
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:02,430
governance stuff. That stuff's
gonna be so varied based on

750
00:39:02,430 --> 00:39:06,960
industry and location. And very
often, customers don't actually

751
00:39:06,960 --> 00:39:10,020
have. They don't understand the
requirements that they have

752
00:39:10,290 --> 00:39:12,780
Andrew Morpeth: muted a lot of
customers exactly in small I

753
00:39:12,780 --> 00:39:15,810
couldn't afford to put that
stuff in. But now they get it.

754
00:39:15,840 --> 00:39:18,870
Yep. So they can deploy it, but
they know nothing about it,

755
00:39:18,870 --> 00:39:19,200
really.

756
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:21,070
Chris Goosen: And if they don't
make the right, you know, it's

757
00:39:21,070 --> 00:39:23,980
almost like making the right
governance decisions up front.

758
00:39:24,040 --> 00:39:27,820
You know, if we take our minds
back to, you know, 8 10 years

759
00:39:27,820 --> 00:39:30,850
ago, when the Yammer was, you
know, first busting up on the

760
00:39:30,850 --> 00:39:33,220
scene may even have been longer
than that. I don't want to go

761
00:39:33,220 --> 00:39:37,510
back that far. But, you know, I
have battle scars from but but

762
00:39:37,540 --> 00:39:40,360
it was one of those things
where, like, if you didn't, in

763
00:39:40,360 --> 00:39:44,560
the very beginning, put in some
really solid governance. It

764
00:39:44,560 --> 00:39:47,530
became such a mess. Yeah. And
and then fixing it retroactively

765
00:39:47,530 --> 00:39:50,380
afterwards was really hard. And
teams is kind of like that, too.

766
00:39:50,380 --> 00:39:53,560
I think like if you just enable
it and just walk away. You're

767
00:39:53,560 --> 00:39:54,700
going to come back in a week and
it's going

768
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:57,000
Paul Bloem: to be absolutely so
so take your Yammer problem.

769
00:39:57,030 --> 00:39:59,040
Yeah. And I'll see your Yeah,
Yammer problem with my

770
00:39:59,040 --> 00:40:02,160
SharePoint issue. Yeah. 10
exactly, which was just to add

771
00:40:02,160 --> 00:40:04,620
on, and she'll be right, what
happened? Yep. And then we'll

772
00:40:04,620 --> 00:40:07,140
throw in some Skype for Business
and a few other bits and pieces.

773
00:40:07,140 --> 00:40:10,710
And guess what? We have the most
complicated combination of

774
00:40:10,710 --> 00:40:14,190
things we've ever seen. Yeah.
And so what could possibly go

775
00:40:14,190 --> 00:40:14,310
wrong?

776
00:40:14,310 --> 00:40:18,000
Chris Goosen: Yeah, exactly. And
people, people almost like

777
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:20,670
because we talked about, and I
said this already one time.

778
00:40:20,880 --> 00:40:24,120
Today, we talk about change
management and adoption a lot on

779
00:40:24,120 --> 00:40:28,470
this on the show. And we talk
about governance and compliance

780
00:40:28,470 --> 00:40:31,080
and all of these things. And a
lot of people think that these

781
00:40:31,080 --> 00:40:33,240
are just buzzwords that we're
throwing out and because they

782
00:40:33,240 --> 00:40:37,080
sound cool, well, this this very
good reason why these things

783
00:40:37,080 --> 00:40:40,590
come up over and over and over
again is because, you know, I'm

784
00:40:40,590 --> 00:40:43,860
sure you guys also see customers
who have not made the right

785
00:40:43,860 --> 00:40:46,920
decisions up front or have kind
of gone down the wrong path just

786
00:40:46,920 --> 00:40:49,470
a little bit and then you come
in and now you're, you're trying

787
00:40:49,470 --> 00:40:53,100
to backtrack just a tad to to
help them out. And so that's it,

788
00:40:53,100 --> 00:40:55,890
you know, the message is
consistent because these things

789
00:40:55,890 --> 00:40:56,670
are really important.

790
00:40:56,700 --> 00:41:01,020
Paul Bloem: Yeah, I tell stories
to the highlight you So we keep

791
00:41:01,020 --> 00:41:03,810
the innocent innocent by not
naming any names. And I always

792
00:41:03,810 --> 00:41:06,870
tell them a story. So depending
on the the organization, and I

793
00:41:06,870 --> 00:41:09,780
use some scary story, I heard a
story last week from a customer

794
00:41:09,780 --> 00:41:13,980
who said, We don't like to, you
know, talking about shadow IT,

795
00:41:13,980 --> 00:41:17,220
we don't like to force our users
down any particular path. There

796
00:41:17,220 --> 00:41:20,550
are creative bunch, and we don't
want to limit that. And of

797
00:41:20,550 --> 00:41:24,210
course, at the same time,
they're they're an organization

798
00:41:24,210 --> 00:41:27,660
who's creating new things. And
if those things were to leak,

799
00:41:27,690 --> 00:41:30,240
yeah, well, that'd be the end of
them. Yep. So once I'm married

800
00:41:30,240 --> 00:41:33,510
those two things together and
said so. So I've got some some

801
00:41:33,510 --> 00:41:35,970
pictures we took the other
night, Andrew, I'll share them

802
00:41:35,970 --> 00:41:38,520
with you. They're my Dropbox and
I accidentally share the entire

803
00:41:38,790 --> 00:41:41,640
Dropbox directory. I also have
some very sensitive information

804
00:41:41,640 --> 00:41:44,970
in there right now and knowing
we have shared with you, and I

805
00:41:44,970 --> 00:41:46,230
can't even tell

806
00:41:46,260 --> 00:41:47,550
Chris Goosen: you access.
Exactly.

807
00:41:47,580 --> 00:41:49,950
Paul Bloem: Yeah. So there's all
this kind of stuff. So I usually

808
00:41:49,950 --> 00:41:52,560
just find an angle for the
customer in question, and then

809
00:41:52,890 --> 00:41:55,830
I'll tell them a story leading
down a path. Yeah. And usually

810
00:41:55,830 --> 00:41:58,140
at the end of it, they've got
these massive eyeballs staring

811
00:41:58,140 --> 00:42:00,300
at me and like I've just scare
the hell out. Do it.

812
00:42:00,750 --> 00:42:02,580
Andrew Morpeth: Yeah. And you
don't have to necessarily go

813
00:42:02,580 --> 00:42:05,400
bananas on it, but you've got to
at least sit down and have the

814
00:42:05,400 --> 00:42:08,730
conversations with the business
and just go, you know, at least

815
00:42:08,730 --> 00:42:12,480
make an informed decision. Yeah.
And goes because fires you can

816
00:42:12,480 --> 00:42:15,870
afford to or want to or you
know, but at least have a bit of

817
00:42:15,870 --> 00:42:17,760
a think about it before you just
didn't roll on

818
00:42:17,820 --> 00:42:18,960
Paul Bloem: know the risks.
Right? Yeah.

819
00:42:18,990 --> 00:42:23,670
Chris Goosen: Yep. I absolutely.
I think that's a very, very good

820
00:42:23,670 --> 00:42:28,110
advice. And it's the kind of, I
guess, top off or come to a

821
00:42:28,110 --> 00:42:31,500
close here, guys, it's been
awesome talking to you. Thank

822
00:42:31,500 --> 00:42:34,530

showing me around Auckland in

824
00:42:36,930 --> 00:42:40,590

want to be found?

827
00:42:45,750 --> 00:42:48,570

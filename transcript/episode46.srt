18
00:01:20,270 --> 00:01:23,330
excited today because we have
someone who I've been personally

19
00:01:23,330 --> 00:01:25,850
wanting to get on the show for a
long time and someone whose work

20
00:01:25,850 --> 00:01:28,340
I've really enjoyed kind of
watching over the last little

21
00:01:28,340 --> 00:01:31,550
bit, and I've used a lot of it
myself. So we have Lee Ford on

22
00:01:31,550 --> 00:01:32,630

23
00:01:33,239 --> 00:01:34,289

25
00:01:36,539 --> 00:01:40,349
it. It's a afternoon time for
you guys in the three of you in

26
00:01:40,379 --> 00:01:45,719
in Europe and South Africa and
morning here in Texas. Lee, do

27
00:01:45,719 --> 00:01:47,729
you want to tell the folks at
home those who don't know you

28
00:01:47,729 --> 00:01:49,289
kind of who you are what you do?

29
00:01:50,170 --> 00:01:53,440
Lee Ford: Absolutely. Yes. So my
name is Lee Ford. I'm based in

30
00:01:53,500 --> 00:01:57,520
Birmingham in the UK. I'm
solution architect for a company

31
00:01:57,520 --> 00:02:04,120
called Symity who predominantly
on Microsoft 365 house. And I

32
00:02:04,120 --> 00:02:09,970
mainly work in the teams part of
Microsoft 365. And that's around

33
00:02:09,970 --> 00:02:14,620
migrating people from Skype for
Business to teams, maybe helping

34
00:02:14,620 --> 00:02:21,100
with the bits around the edges
around automation and scripting

35
00:02:21,430 --> 00:02:26,140
and application development. So
it's kind of a as you know,

36
00:02:26,140 --> 00:02:29,830
teams is such a wide net these
days pet something like Skype

37
00:02:29,830 --> 00:02:32,320
for Business where it was just
sort of meetings telephony and,

38
00:02:32,740 --> 00:02:37,240
and I am now it's, yeah, it's,
it's pretty much the centerpiece

39
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:41,620
of, of Microsoft 365. So yeah,
that's pretty much where I spend

40
00:02:41,620 --> 00:02:42,760
most my time working.

41
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:46,590
Chris Goosen: Awesome. Yeah,
that's, um, you're right, it is.

42
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:50,640
And it's getting wider, right?
It's not just where it was like

43
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:53,730
six months ago or a year ago and
it just continues to improve and

44
00:02:53,730 --> 00:02:56,430
increase and get wider and I
noticed this week there was an

45
00:02:56,430 --> 00:02:58,620
announcement about some advanced
licensing which seems to be

46
00:02:58,620 --> 00:03:01,560
ruffling some feathers Which we
could probably get into Warren

47
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:06,720
might have some some opinion on
that. But so did you come from a

48
00:03:06,780 --> 00:03:10,080
traditional like from the Skype
or Lync world? Or is teams kind

49
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:14,490
of your kind of where you got
into working with, I guess the

50
00:03:14,790 --> 00:03:16,200
that productivity stack?

51
00:03:17,410 --> 00:03:19,900
Lee Ford: Yeah, so
traditionally, I came from when

52
00:03:19,900 --> 00:03:24,670
I first started I did PBX So,
things like Mitel and Avaya PBX

53
00:03:24,670 --> 00:03:30,070
is Mitel Well yeah, what a while
ago now but that's kind of where

54
00:03:30,070 --> 00:03:34,450
a scary Phone Guy Yeah, I'm very
funny. Yeah, you either come

55
00:03:34,450 --> 00:03:37,570
from Windows Server or you come
from like telephones and I came

56
00:03:37,570 --> 00:03:44,950
from the telephones side. And
and this new product Lync or

57
00:03:45,310 --> 00:03:48,610
OCS, I guess came in and we will
Oh, well Cisco anything's and we

58
00:03:48,610 --> 00:03:51,010
want to have a have a bit of a
poke around and see what it is

59
00:03:51,010 --> 00:03:54,190
if it's any good or, and that
was kind of it really, from that

60
00:03:54,190 --> 00:03:58,690
point on, you know, I've just
sort of that's where I want it

61
00:03:58,690 --> 00:04:03,430
to be. You know, that's many,
many years ago now and yeah, so

62
00:04:03,430 --> 00:04:07,240
it's kind of been through the
evolution of ACS link of the

63
00:04:07,240 --> 00:04:10,690
Skype for Business server and
Skype for Business Online. And

64
00:04:10,690 --> 00:04:14,110
then obviously teams is where we
are now. So yeah, it's kind of

65
00:04:14,110 --> 00:04:16,540
been there a little while now
been doing it. But

66
00:04:16,630 --> 00:04:20,050
traditionally, it was a PBX,
which does come in handy when

67
00:04:20,050 --> 00:04:23,770
you're doing PBX migrations, and
you know, they've got PBX that

68
00:04:23,770 --> 00:04:26,590
you're familiar with you. Oh,
great. Yeah, I can, I can help

69
00:04:26,590 --> 00:04:26,980
out here.

70
00:04:27,630 --> 00:04:31,230
Chris Goosen: It's to me that is
so so your background is very,

71
00:04:31,230 --> 00:04:34,320
very similar to Greg Sheridan,
who I think you know, and he's a

72
00:04:34,860 --> 00:04:37,950
close friend of mine. We worked
together for many years. Back in

73
00:04:37,950 --> 00:04:42,930
Australia, very similar, but I
think what makes that awesome is

74
00:04:42,930 --> 00:04:47,310
that people coming from that
voice background. When you look

75
00:04:47,310 --> 00:04:51,030
at an SBC or like a telephony
gateway, you just go Yeah, this

76
00:04:51,030 --> 00:04:54,270
makes perfect sense to me.
Whereas for me coming from you

77
00:04:54,270 --> 00:04:57,390
know, messaging background and
and the way like SMTP routing

78
00:04:57,390 --> 00:05:00,570
works, I log into an order codes
and like the stuff does not make

79
00:05:00,570 --> 00:05:03,780
any sense whatsoever to be
right. So it's always

80
00:05:03,780 --> 00:05:07,020
interesting when I kind of need
help on you know on a sonar or

81
00:05:07,020 --> 00:05:10,560
something or whatever they call
themselves this week. I call I

82
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:15,120
call Greg for for help, but it
works the other way as well.

83
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:18,720
Right he you know if he if he
has some DNS or some weird Yeah,

84
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:22,230
it's always DNS, but if you have
some weird, some weird thing

85
00:05:22,230 --> 00:05:24,930
that he likes troubleshoot, then
you know, he'll ping me and so

86
00:05:25,080 --> 00:05:27,900
we've had that kind of
collaborative relationship for a

87
00:05:27,900 --> 00:05:29,820
long time. But you know,
especially because I've never

88
00:05:29,820 --> 00:05:33,720
met anyone else who's come that
far along out of that kind of

89
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:34,800
PBX moto world.

90
00:05:35,250 --> 00:05:38,070
Lee Ford: Yeah, no, absolutely.
Like, you know, I remember when

91
00:05:38,070 --> 00:05:41,820
I first started many, many years
ago, over 20 years now, it was

92
00:05:43,290 --> 00:05:46,350
Yeah, running cables for
telephones, you know, where I

93
00:05:46,350 --> 00:05:49,560
sort of first started you know,
and you know, that just is

94
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:54,420
unheard of now, it's just seems
such a such a far away thing,

95
00:05:54,420 --> 00:05:57,810
really. Whereas now everything's
virtual. You can work from home,

96
00:05:57,840 --> 00:06:01,920
you can work anywhere and with
Coronavirus. It's Yeah, it's

97
00:06:01,920 --> 00:06:02,970
more than welcome isn't it
really

98
00:06:03,060 --> 00:06:05,340
Warren du Toit: and those big
cabling cabinets with those

99
00:06:05,340 --> 00:06:09,900
piers and you know they're like
100 pair cable or 400 pair cable

100
00:06:09,930 --> 00:06:14,670
and there was like literally it
was like this bare

101
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:19,170
Lee Ford: bones set Yeah,
absolutely yeah that's a number

102
00:06:19,170 --> 00:06:22,680
that I think I've probably stole
but the tool somewhere but every

103
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:25,170
so often someone I go You know,
I've got an old telephone line

104
00:06:25,170 --> 00:06:28,410
that needs moving or something
like that and yeah, I'm still

105
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:30,840
still always keep the tools just
in case you need them.

106
00:06:31,140 --> 00:06:38,160
Chris Goosen: It's a separate
track the skill set that's

107
00:06:38,250 --> 00:06:42,630
that's where I started right my
my old man still does do data

108
00:06:42,660 --> 00:06:47,010
data networks and now it's he's
moved away from like, PBX stuff

109
00:06:47,010 --> 00:06:49,680
and phone cabling, right but
it's still data networking,

110
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:51,840
because obviously all of this
stuff runs off a data backbone

111
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:57,000
now and fiber and I mean, I was
you know, I was in like primary

112
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:00,840
school. Boot every every school
Holliday, that's what I was

113
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:03,960
doing. I was pulling cables and
terminating cabinets and stuff,

114
00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:07,260
right. And I think starting at
that sort of very, very, very

115
00:07:07,260 --> 00:07:09,960
ground level gives you a real
appreciation of where we've

116
00:07:09,960 --> 00:07:13,770
gotten to now. So yeah, that's,
that's super fascinating. And I

117
00:07:13,770 --> 00:07:16,560
forget how I was gonna say it's
a super handy skill set. Because

118
00:07:16,650 --> 00:07:19,440
now when I need a cat six drop
in a room somewhere, I'm like, I

119
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:20,400
just do that. It's good.

120
00:07:20,460 --> 00:07:21,330
Warren du Toit: Yeah, so lately,

121
00:07:22,500 --> 00:07:24,480
Chris Goosen: I'm getting really
good at fixing drywall holes now

122
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:27,120
too, because every time I need
to do this, I need to cut a hole

123
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:29,160
in my wall. And so

124
00:07:30,480 --> 00:07:30,990
Nicolas Blank: just

125
00:07:31,049 --> 00:07:33,659
Warren du Toit: so you saw Well,
we've we've got bricks here.

126
00:07:33,749 --> 00:07:34,499
Yeah, mate.

127
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:41,880
Chris Goosen: So moving, moving
back to teams, I guess. So we're

128
00:07:41,880 --> 00:07:44,580
in this place now where
obviously team's adoption has

129
00:07:44,580 --> 00:07:48,960
skyrocketed over the last you
know, well, since March is right

130
00:07:49,020 --> 00:07:51,810
in like every time I look at the
numbers, they just astounding. I

131
00:07:51,810 --> 00:07:54,240
mean, last time I saw it was
like 75 million, I think but

132
00:07:54,270 --> 00:07:58,710
it's probably gone up since
then. What about the PBX side of

133
00:07:58,710 --> 00:08:01,290
teams? Are you seeing your
experience are customers using

134
00:08:01,290 --> 00:08:03,870
it? Is it something that people
are actively getting rid of

135
00:08:03,870 --> 00:08:08,070
their, whatever is left for
Avaya Mitel type stuff in using

136
00:08:08,070 --> 00:08:08,550
teams.

137
00:08:09,510 --> 00:08:11,220
Lee Ford: apps? Absolutely.
That's the case.

138
00:08:12,480 --> 00:08:15,720
Not and but pre COVID. That was
also the case that, you know,

139
00:08:16,020 --> 00:08:19,920
people are looking to move away
from your fixed phone on a desk,

140
00:08:20,700 --> 00:08:23,340
you know, they want to be, you
know, to the ability to, you

141
00:08:23,340 --> 00:08:25,920
know, have that, you know, their
desk or their landline number.

142
00:08:26,100 --> 00:08:28,170
That'd be a transact call on a
mobile, if they're working from

143
00:08:28,170 --> 00:08:31,680
home or, you know, wherever they
are in the world. And they can

144
00:08:31,710 --> 00:08:35,490
sort of take those calls. And
especially now with COVID,

145
00:08:35,490 --> 00:08:38,220
where, you know, offices are
either closed or running at a

146
00:08:38,220 --> 00:08:40,650
reduced capacity. There's a lot
of desk phones sitting there

147
00:08:40,650 --> 00:08:45,270
idle, and people aren't able to
use their telephones. So yeah,

148
00:08:45,300 --> 00:08:47,460
absolutely. We're seeing a
massive increase of people

149
00:08:47,460 --> 00:08:51,960
wanting to move away from
traditional PBX is and move over

150
00:08:51,960 --> 00:08:54,570
to teams where it just gives
them the flexibility that they

151
00:08:54,570 --> 00:09:01,500
can just use the number or ever
and yeah, we are seeing sizeable

152
00:09:01,560 --> 00:09:08,970
uptake in in telephony, and not
only is it people wanting it,

153
00:09:08,970 --> 00:09:11,190
but they're wanting it
yesterday, you know that they

154
00:09:11,190 --> 00:09:15,450
want it now. You know, with
COVID It's, it's, it's gone from

155
00:09:15,450 --> 00:09:19,080
being Yeah. Or we will do that
in 12 months, 18 months. Well,

156
00:09:19,140 --> 00:09:21,960
we'll, we'll write out our PBX
as long as we, you know, as long

157
00:09:21,960 --> 00:09:25,500
as we can. So we need it now we
need, you know, we've got key

158
00:09:25,500 --> 00:09:30,000
numbers that need to be, you
know, terminating on users work

159
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:33,720
from home PBX can't do it. How
can you help? So absolutely.

160
00:09:34,650 --> 00:09:35,190
Fair enough.

161
00:09:35,220 --> 00:09:37,500
Chris Goosen: Yeah. So I think
that's, I mean, that is that is

162
00:09:37,500 --> 00:09:40,800
interesting, right? Because if
you think about all of the

163
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:44,310
logistics that go into a company
just closing its premises,

164
00:09:44,310 --> 00:09:47,070
right? I mean, you know, it's
easy to go Okay, well, guys,

165
00:09:47,070 --> 00:09:51,180
like us, we've been lightly
working or working remotely. And

166
00:09:51,180 --> 00:09:53,730
I should say folks like us have
been working remotely for a

167
00:09:53,730 --> 00:09:56,790
while. And so we're used to
being able to just carry a

168
00:09:56,790 --> 00:09:59,220
number around with us, whatever.
But if you think about the

169
00:09:59,250 --> 00:10:03,870
situation where You know, you
have some sort of inbound

170
00:10:03,870 --> 00:10:07,410
calling number or reception
number or something like that,

171
00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:09,960
like the logistical and I had to
think about this just the other

172
00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:13,740
day cuz someone asked me a
question about, like, Oh, we, we

173
00:10:13,740 --> 00:10:16,590
have to shut up our office. And
so like, someone has to look

174
00:10:16,590 --> 00:10:19,200
after that phone number, like
what do we do with that? Right?

175
00:10:19,410 --> 00:10:22,680
It's interesting. I mean, if
it's just a line sitting, you

176
00:10:22,680 --> 00:10:24,840
know, a prep terminating in your
premises, that's gonna be a lot

177
00:10:24,840 --> 00:10:27,240
harder to do. I guess call
forwarding is always an option,

178
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:29,820
right, but still makes it much
more convenient when you can do

179
00:10:30,660 --> 00:10:32,940
something like that. Bring it
into into teams.

180
00:10:34,110 --> 00:10:37,470
Lee Ford: Absolutely. Yeah,
there's, yeah, we're having

181
00:10:37,470 --> 00:10:40,350
customers at the moment,
literally just forwarding calls

182
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:45,480
to to Microsoft Teams number
just as a quick win, you know,

183
00:10:45,480 --> 00:10:48,990
with with the with the prospect
of moving those numbers properly

184
00:10:48,990 --> 00:10:51,870
and importing those numbers at a
later date, but just with time

185
00:10:51,870 --> 00:10:55,500
is of the essence they need to
need to move across quickly.

186
00:10:55,500 --> 00:10:58,890
Yeah, so absolutely. That that
you say there's a lot of

187
00:10:58,890 --> 00:11:02,040
logistics involved with Closing
in office and telephony is

188
00:11:02,040 --> 00:11:04,110
absolutely one of those ones.
Especially when you've got

189
00:11:04,110 --> 00:11:07,230
things that you know, emergency
hotlines and things like that,

190
00:11:07,230 --> 00:11:09,360
that you know, you can't have
downtime. You can't have people

191
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:13,050
not answering the phone. It is
it is a key service really.

192
00:11:13,540 --> 00:11:16,450
Chris Goosen: Okay. So sorry,
Nick, you go Go ahead.

193
00:11:17,140 --> 00:11:22,120
Nicolas Blank: Yeah, I wanted to
ask you since you have the the

194
00:11:22,120 --> 00:11:25,630
scary Phone Guy background and
we say scary Phone Guy, because

195
00:11:25,630 --> 00:11:29,470
as Windows people, we look at
like all the standards that you

196
00:11:29,470 --> 00:11:33,550
guys just find so easy and
codecs and everything else. And

197
00:11:33,550 --> 00:11:38,140
it's like, no, that's scary. So
excuse me Phone Guy. So if you

198
00:11:38,140 --> 00:11:41,860
look at the the commercial side
of the house, if you look at the

199
00:11:41,860 --> 00:11:45,970
cost of a traditional PBX and
those folks now moving over to

200
00:11:45,970 --> 00:11:52,810
teams, do you find that there's
a massive upside from a moving

201
00:11:52,840 --> 00:11:55,420
my voice over to teams point of
view that those folks are

202
00:11:55,420 --> 00:11:58,390
getting that they couldn't get
on the traditional PBX is of the

203
00:11:58,390 --> 00:11:58,750
world

204
00:12:00,809 --> 00:12:02,999
Lee Ford: From a from a cost
perspective, there probably is

205
00:12:02,999 --> 00:12:06,089
some say. I mean, there's
obviously two types, two left

206
00:12:06,239 --> 00:12:09,659
teams, you've got calling plans
and then you've also got the the

207
00:12:09,659 --> 00:12:15,659
direct routing. Certainly with
direct routing, that there is a

208
00:12:15,659 --> 00:12:18,929
cost there can be a cost saving
by moving to that rather than

209
00:12:19,259 --> 00:12:22,529
sticking with the PBX, you know,
coming up for renewal. And a lot

210
00:12:22,529 --> 00:12:24,569
of the times you know that they
might be on E five, in which

211
00:12:24,629 --> 00:12:27,329
case they've already got phone
system built in and I think

212
00:12:27,329 --> 00:12:30,299
recently has been out so that in
some regions, there's also

213
00:12:30,299 --> 00:12:33,599
minutes bundled into the five
that all of a sudden is like,

214
00:12:33,599 --> 00:12:37,169
well, we're already paying for
it. Why are we not using it? So

215
00:12:37,169 --> 00:12:41,849
yeah, we see that people are Oh,
yeah, it's it's a win win.

216
00:12:41,849 --> 00:12:44,399
Really, we've already got the
licenses we need to replace our

217
00:12:44,399 --> 00:12:50,249
PBX teams is the natural choice.
When it comes to teams from a

218
00:12:50,249 --> 00:12:53,849
functional level filling the
need of the PBX. It's ever

219
00:12:53,849 --> 00:12:56,519
improving things like call
queues and auto attendance are

220
00:12:58,109 --> 00:13:00,659
getting better their features
are being added almost All the

221
00:13:00,659 --> 00:13:05,669
time. There is obviously going
to be cases where, well, my old

222
00:13:05,669 --> 00:13:09,359
PBX did this in a particular
way, we need the same. And you

223
00:13:09,359 --> 00:13:11,219
can't always offer that. But you
might be better off or

224
00:13:11,219 --> 00:13:13,859
something, you know that the old
PBX couldn't do that maybe

225
00:13:13,859 --> 00:13:19,439
better. So it's always a balance
between managing what you can do

226
00:13:19,439 --> 00:13:24,059
and what they should probably
do. With regards to PBX

227
00:13:24,059 --> 00:13:26,579
replacement, but yeah, I think a
lot of people are like, we've

228
00:13:26,579 --> 00:13:28,199
got licenses, let's use it,
let's go.

229
00:13:29,620 --> 00:13:31,660
Warren du Toit: What are the
people that don't have licenses?

230
00:13:31,960 --> 00:13:35,080
I mean, like, I'm finding it
sometimes the teams actually

231
00:13:35,080 --> 00:13:39,130
works at a more expensive number
one, and I use that that's sort

232
00:13:39,130 --> 00:13:43,270
of like easy to my next question
is, like, so in South Africa,

233
00:13:43,270 --> 00:13:46,480
we've got no choice, right? We
have to use direct routing.

234
00:13:47,380 --> 00:13:51,430
Yeah. Because routing apparently
is a bad word in some parts of

235
00:13:51,430 --> 00:13:58,000
the world. In Australia. Anyway,
so like, we've got a choice

236
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,400
right? So that's, that's fine. I
mean, but like If you have to

237
00:14:00,400 --> 00:14:04,480
consider what phone system costs
on an E three, it's actually

238
00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:07,240
pretty expensive. I mean, you
can get a hosted PBX number,

239
00:14:07,420 --> 00:14:09,490
like through a little portal,
you can click a click, and it's

240
00:14:09,490 --> 00:14:13,660
really not that however, like,
if you have to look at Call

241
00:14:13,660 --> 00:14:15,010
Quality Dashboard.

242
00:14:16,080 --> 00:14:19,410
And the improvements that have
been done there. Your article,

243
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:23,820
which was released a month ago
was yesterday, now a month ago.

244
00:14:24,420 --> 00:14:29,370
June. Yeah, yeah. Yeah, that's a
great article, man. And you

245
00:14:29,370 --> 00:14:33,240
can't do that sort of like with
a hosted PBX or something like

246
00:14:33,240 --> 00:14:34,980
that, and you wouldn't be able
to get these sorts of

247
00:14:34,980 --> 00:14:38,760
statistics. And I guess, having
an all in one box. So my

248
00:14:38,760 --> 00:14:41,100
questions would be like, Are
there any features that you

249
00:14:41,100 --> 00:14:46,860
think Microsoft's forgotten
about? Or, I mean, like, I find

250
00:14:46,860 --> 00:14:49,710
that they're really, really like
that teams, admin centers

251
00:14:49,710 --> 00:14:52,110
getting packed full of stuff
every day. And I think it's, I

252
00:14:52,110 --> 00:14:54,450
think it's going well, but I
mean, do you think anything's

253
00:14:54,450 --> 00:14:58,200
missing? Do you think anything's
like, do you think that direct

254
00:14:58,200 --> 00:15:00,480
routing should have been
configured with the admin By

255
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:00,840
now.

256
00:15:02,220 --> 00:15:05,580
Lee Ford: Yeah, I mean, yeah,
absolutely. So I think

257
00:15:05,580 --> 00:15:08,220
previously, certainly when it
first launched, it was pretty

258
00:15:08,220 --> 00:15:10,650
much PowerShell is the way you
need to do a lot of it only

259
00:15:10,650 --> 00:15:14,400
Yeah, yeah, a PowerShell only.
And now they've added things

260
00:15:14,400 --> 00:15:18,690
like normalization rules and
voice routes. And I mean, I'm a

261
00:15:18,690 --> 00:15:21,450
PowerShell. Guy. So I always
generally still do it via

262
00:15:21,450 --> 00:15:25,860
PowerShell. But I'm pretty sure
you configure the whole thing

263
00:15:25,860 --> 00:15:28,920
for direct routing, maybe not
all of it, but let's say 95% of

264
00:15:28,920 --> 00:15:32,880
it via the admin center now, and
I think that's intentional,

265
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:39,510
because they want to get people
that maybe on PowerShell experts

266
00:15:39,510 --> 00:15:43,200
to want to be able to just
quickly click, you know, you

267
00:15:43,200 --> 00:15:45,570
will even just make changes, I
want to be able to click a

268
00:15:45,750 --> 00:15:48,090
couple of tweaks, something like
a normalization or, you know,

269
00:15:48,090 --> 00:15:50,280
regular expression. Not
everyone's gonna know what

270
00:15:50,280 --> 00:15:53,100
regular expressions are. They've
made that easier where it builds

271
00:15:53,100 --> 00:15:55,920
the regular expression for you a
bit like they did with Skype for

272
00:15:55,920 --> 00:15:56,700
Business server.

273
00:15:56,880 --> 00:16:01,740
Warren du Toit: So it was a
reason I failed my 333 exam.

274
00:16:02,250 --> 00:16:07,650
Those damn regular expressions,
man. Yeah. is different.

275
00:16:08,040 --> 00:16:10,530
Lee Ford: Yeah, absolutely. I
mean, I'm not an expert on

276
00:16:10,530 --> 00:16:13,590
regular expressions. I do kind
of get enough. But yeah, even

277
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:18,060
even, I think everyone still has
to use some sort of online tool,

278
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:22,470
just because I need this
particular pattern. And it's

279
00:16:22,500 --> 00:16:24,720
Yeah, when you break it down, it
makes sense. But then when you

280
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:26,910
put it all together, it's and
just look at string. It's Oh,

281
00:16:26,910 --> 00:16:28,380
hang on what'shappening here? so
much.

282
00:16:29,880 --> 00:16:32,850
So So yeah, I think I think it's
getting there. I've been sent. I

283
00:16:32,850 --> 00:16:35,790
think with direct routing,
they're adding pretty cool

284
00:16:35,790 --> 00:16:40,560
features like LMS, a local media
optimization, where the media

285
00:16:40,590 --> 00:16:43,680
from the team's client doesn't
have to go up to Office 365. It

286
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:46,890
can get media bypass. Yeah,
yeah. Media bypass via the local

287
00:16:47,190 --> 00:16:50,070
SBC while and having to go out
and back in. So there are

288
00:16:50,070 --> 00:16:53,940
improvements. I think there
probably could be improvements

289
00:16:53,940 --> 00:16:59,820
in the voice applications,
things like cool pickup, so

290
00:16:59,820 --> 00:17:03,300
there's They have a term I think
it's called group pickup, which

291
00:17:03,300 --> 00:17:08,520
is kind of I wouldn't call it
pickup group personally, like

292
00:17:08,520 --> 00:17:12,930
you would on traditional PBX.
It's more, it rings the, if you

293
00:17:12,960 --> 00:17:15,720
divert your call to another user
and their phone doesn't ring,

294
00:17:15,720 --> 00:17:19,170
but it audibly flashes that's
classed as a pickup call pick up

295
00:17:19,170 --> 00:17:22,050
that's not really a pick up
group in my eyes, but the things

296
00:17:22,050 --> 00:17:25,470
that I think they could
potentially improve on. But I

297
00:17:25,470 --> 00:17:30,720
think on the whole it's Yeah, I
think it's, it's, it's if

298
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:32,730
someone was going, we want to
move off, move away from our

299
00:17:32,730 --> 00:17:35,640
PBX, we want to get your teams,
I really would never have any

300
00:17:35,640 --> 00:17:38,130
hesitation in going Yep, sure.
Let's go. I don't think they'd

301
00:17:38,130 --> 00:17:39,720
be like, Oh, hang on a minute.
Are you doing this? Are you

302
00:17:39,720 --> 00:17:42,750
doing that without routing,
which makes it kind of answers

303
00:17:42,750 --> 00:17:46,170
all those edge case questions
around things like dect phones

304
00:17:46,170 --> 00:17:48,690
or Analog Devices or anything
like that, that you have to

305
00:17:48,690 --> 00:17:49,170
keep.

306
00:17:51,510 --> 00:17:53,430
And you couldn't do that we call
them fans and all of a sudden

307
00:17:53,460 --> 00:17:54,930
direct routing gives you that
extra option.

308
00:17:56,280 --> 00:17:59,070
Chris Goosen: So I think both
the both of you guys have

309
00:17:59,070 --> 00:18:02,130
actually kind of queued up for
segwayed the question I was

310
00:18:02,130 --> 00:18:07,530
gonna, I was gonna ask earlier,
which is, how is teams differing

311
00:18:07,530 --> 00:18:09,300
in the regions, though, right?
And this was actually gonna be a

312
00:18:09,300 --> 00:18:12,930
question to both Warren and you,
Lee, because I know like, here

313
00:18:12,930 --> 00:18:15,030
in the US, we just take things
for granted that like, because

314
00:18:15,030 --> 00:18:17,370
when the feature comes out, we
just have it. But But there are

315
00:18:17,370 --> 00:18:20,580
other regions. I know, Australia
is one of those regions as well,

316
00:18:20,580 --> 00:18:23,730
it's sometimes lags a little
behind what's possible, what's

317
00:18:23,730 --> 00:18:27,840
not possible. So, I mean, are we
getting to a point where things

318
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:30,540
are being released across
everywhere, like all the regions

319
00:18:30,540 --> 00:18:33,900
now or, Warren, you alluded to
the fact that that may in South

320
00:18:33,900 --> 00:18:36,180
Africa right now you can only do
direct routing, so there's no

321
00:18:36,180 --> 00:18:37,470
Copeland stuff available?

322
00:18:38,250 --> 00:18:42,390
Warren du Toit: No, so he said,
it's, it's, it's a complicated

323
00:18:42,840 --> 00:18:45,600
thing, because you see, in order
to become a teller in order to

324
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:50,670
become a telco, you need like a
telco license, right. And like,

325
00:18:50,670 --> 00:18:53,730
apparently, it costs doesn't
want to use Microsoft Word, or

326
00:18:53,730 --> 00:18:57,840
whatever the case would be, so
they can't like sort of legally

327
00:18:57,990 --> 00:19:01,740
be a calling plan provider. At
least that's sort of what

328
00:19:01,740 --> 00:19:05,160
they've said when I when when
when Microsoft gives you an

329
00:19:05,160 --> 00:19:07,620
answer about where the calling
plans are available or not. So

330
00:19:07,620 --> 00:19:08,070
it costs

331
00:19:08,460 --> 00:19:09,960
Chris Goosen: a governing body
for

332
00:19:10,770 --> 00:19:13,200
Warren du Toit: the governing
body for communications in South

333
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:18,570
Africa. So you know, like, yeah,
so, but again, you know, the

334
00:19:18,570 --> 00:19:21,870
strange thing is, is obviously,
and Lee you can, you could

335
00:19:21,870 --> 00:19:24,960
probably attest to this is that
even though calling plans are

336
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:27,900
available in the States, I mean,
when I was working at the team's

337
00:19:27,900 --> 00:19:33,030
booth at Ignite last year, I got
so many questions about direct

338
00:19:33,030 --> 00:19:37,170
routing purely because guys
wanted to use their existing

339
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:41,400
Cisco call manager or they had
this massive investment in an

340
00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:45,480
existing PBX that they couldn't
just get rid of right now. And

341
00:19:45,510 --> 00:19:47,760
and they wanted to connect the
two together and direct routing

342
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:51,300
is the way I mean calling plan
sort of that so so direct

343
00:19:51,300 --> 00:19:54,840
routing is like sort of a more
like, like a multi tier approach

344
00:19:56,070 --> 00:19:59,280
when it comes to that sort of
integration because these guys

345
00:19:59,340 --> 00:20:02,700
like they don't I mean, you'd be
surprised how many people like

346
00:20:02,700 --> 00:20:05,820
all over the world I mean, like
jabber jabber is such a thing,

347
00:20:05,820 --> 00:20:08,760
man. I don't know how why but
jabber is a thing.

348
00:20:09,060 --> 00:20:14,820
Lee Ford: Yeah. I've never
touched it. But yeah. It's,

349
00:20:15,900 --> 00:20:16,200
it's,

350
00:20:17,890 --> 00:20:20,770
Warren du Toit: it's under, it's
an on prem investment. Like,

351
00:20:21,400 --> 00:20:23,380
like, they use.

352
00:20:23,910 --> 00:20:27,960
Yeah. And you know, like I don't
even know if they have a proper

353
00:20:27,960 --> 00:20:32,430
hybrid model. As far as if you
want to move from let's say

354
00:20:32,430 --> 00:20:36,360
jabber to WebEx, which is, you
know, hosted. And then you get

355
00:20:36,360 --> 00:20:39,180
your calling plan from WebEx. I
don't even know if there's,

356
00:20:39,210 --> 00:20:40,590
there's a hybrid model.

357
00:20:41,730 --> 00:20:45,960
Lee Ford: Like Yeah, so I don't
know. Yeah, so so on the calling

358
00:20:45,960 --> 00:20:48,810
plans versus direct routing. So
calling plans available and I

359
00:20:48,810 --> 00:20:52,290
think eight countries that
didn't any been added for at

360
00:20:52,290 --> 00:20:55,920
least a couple of years and I
think Japan or maybe Australia

361
00:20:55,920 --> 00:21:00,990
with the last couple to be added
and in those last They think

362
00:21:00,990 --> 00:21:03,930
they had to partner with Sony in
Australia that depart with I

363
00:21:03,930 --> 00:21:07,740
think Telstra. So, Telstra don't
actually provide the service

364
00:21:07,740 --> 00:21:11,310
Telstra do. And there's like a
specific skew you have to have.

365
00:21:11,670 --> 00:21:16,380
It's not your traditional
license. It's like a Telstra

366
00:21:16,410 --> 00:21:19,260
based license. So that way
they've kind of got around

367
00:21:19,260 --> 00:21:23,190
having to be a provider in that
location. I think that I think

368
00:21:23,190 --> 00:21:26,100
there's some of seeing somewhere
that that they're planning

369
00:21:26,100 --> 00:21:28,410
schildt they are so planning to
roll out to other countries. But

370
00:21:28,410 --> 00:21:30,900
that's not to say there hasn't
been for a couple of years. But

371
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:35,040
even in the UK, with finding
that most people go direct

372
00:21:35,040 --> 00:21:37,350
routing, and that's because like
you say you have a PBX and you

373
00:21:37,350 --> 00:21:41,070
want to do a gradual migration
or you've got an existing

374
00:21:41,610 --> 00:21:44,850
agreement with a provider.
That's, you know, yeah, too cost

375
00:21:44,850 --> 00:21:47,310
prohibitive to actually want to
move away from it when you add

376
00:21:47,310 --> 00:21:52,320
on the calling plan cost. And
typically, like say calling

377
00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:55,410
plans we're finding that people
are rather put that money into

378
00:21:55,410 --> 00:22:00,240
an SBC and and stick with their
current provider of money. Gives

379
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:04,500
them extra flexibility to switch
providers down the road and

380
00:22:04,500 --> 00:22:06,300
whatnot. So what we're finding

381
00:22:07,260 --> 00:22:10,380
Warren du Toit: which leads me
to my next question is why audio

382
00:22:10,380 --> 00:22:15,090
codes? Like I'm also like, I
mean really like the great

383
00:22:15,090 --> 00:22:20,370
products and stuff. However,
they're not cheap. You have to

384
00:22:20,370 --> 00:22:23,310
look at like a like a any node
SBC. I mean that things like

385
00:22:23,310 --> 00:22:24,660
literally attend to the brass.

386
00:22:25,050 --> 00:22:28,440
Lee Ford: There's really I've
never actually so I know ran

387
00:22:28,440 --> 00:22:31,500
out, you know, Randy Chairman,
he's he's talked about any node

388
00:22:31,500 --> 00:22:36,930
before he works, where I do. And
he's saying, Oh, you know, you

389
00:22:36,930 --> 00:22:40,110
should have a look one day and
you know, he's got a blog post

390
00:22:40,110 --> 00:22:40,650
about it, but

391
00:22:40,980 --> 00:22:43,260
Warren du Toit: I don't really
is pretty. I mean, the console

392
00:22:43,260 --> 00:22:46,800
looks like AWS. Okay. Yeah.

393
00:22:48,060 --> 00:22:52,110
Lee Ford: Yeah. Yeah, no, it's
it's um, yeah, I mean, to be

394
00:22:52,110 --> 00:22:54,750
fair, the audiocodes ui used to
look horrendous.

395
00:22:54,780 --> 00:22:55,950
Warren du Toit: Back load was
better.

396
00:22:56,820 --> 00:22:59,400
Lee Ford: So when people go it's
really bad about hard to use.

397
00:22:59,400 --> 00:23:02,940
Now. Thinking You want to use it
like five years ago? It was

398
00:23:02,940 --> 00:23:07,320
something else. So, yeah, I've
never touched a ribbon. What I

399
00:23:07,320 --> 00:23:10,200
think where I work, there's a
kind of a 5050 split between

400
00:23:10,530 --> 00:23:17,070
audiocodes and ribbon. Its
expertise. And I'm sure ribbon

401
00:23:17,340 --> 00:23:20,340
is just as good as audiocodes
it's just Yeah, I've always been

402
00:23:20,340 --> 00:23:23,640
the audiocodes that will the
code side of the, of the camera.

403
00:23:24,360 --> 00:23:26,280
Yeah, it's difficult to sort

404
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:31,100
Warren du Toit: of transition
from one sort of tiller, like

405
00:23:31,130 --> 00:23:34,790
sort of provided to the next
because they are very different.

406
00:23:34,820 --> 00:23:38,660
And like, if you look at
interfaces and commands and what

407
00:23:38,660 --> 00:23:43,430
has to be run on a and the way,
like the flows work and what one

408
00:23:43,430 --> 00:23:46,010
thing's called on the one side,
and one thing's called on the

409
00:23:46,010 --> 00:23:48,470
other side, you can get
incredibly confused. I mean,

410
00:23:48,680 --> 00:23:51,170
sometimes they don't I mean,
like, on an any node, it's

411
00:23:51,170 --> 00:23:55,280
called a trunk. Right? But
audiocodes doesn't really use

412
00:23:55,280 --> 00:23:56,630
the word trunk ever.

413
00:23:57,470 --> 00:23:59,780
Lee Ford: Unless it's ISDN I
think Yeah. Which technically

414
00:23:59,780 --> 00:24:05,270
isn't But yeah, it means Yeah.
They were like sardines and sip

415
00:24:05,270 --> 00:24:08,900
interfaces and all those direct
good things. Yeah,

416
00:24:09,090 --> 00:24:11,340
Chris Goosen: this is this I've
always wondered this and it's

417
00:24:11,340 --> 00:24:13,740
always fascinated me right? I
wonder if this is also a little

418
00:24:13,740 --> 00:24:17,460
bit of a regional thing because
I know like ever since I've I've

419
00:24:17,460 --> 00:24:22,200
lived here in the US it's always
been audiocodes, right? Like

420
00:24:22,200 --> 00:24:24,990
where I've worked in the past
that the guys don't even people

421
00:24:24,990 --> 00:24:28,290
don't even look at anything
else. But when I was when I was

422
00:24:28,290 --> 00:24:30,150
working in Australia, every
partner I've ever worked for it

423
00:24:30,150 --> 00:24:34,500
was always so not open ribbon.
Yeah, as an alkaloid. So I

424
00:24:34,500 --> 00:24:38,460
wonder how much of that is
regional versus just

425
00:24:38,540 --> 00:24:41,840
Lee Ford: I think it is. It's
interesting. Yeah. Okay. Yeah,

426
00:24:41,840 --> 00:24:46,700
Warren du Toit: South Africa
they use Asterix because it's

427
00:24:46,700 --> 00:24:47,000
free.

428
00:24:49,590 --> 00:24:54,240
Chris Goosen: So, shifting gears
just a little bit here. I so at

429
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:59,130
least one of the things I think
and so Bobby, the reason we got

430
00:24:59,130 --> 00:25:01,860
to know each other was I was I
was working on a project a

431
00:25:01,860 --> 00:25:05,010
couple. This would have been
probably about a year ago now.

432
00:25:05,730 --> 00:25:09,450
And I was trying to do some
funky stuff with like, exporting

433
00:25:09,450 --> 00:25:12,990
conversation history out of
teams conversations. And, and I

434
00:25:12,990 --> 00:25:17,070
was at the time, the way I tried
I was trying to do this was I

435
00:25:17,070 --> 00:25:22,440
had done a discovery search of
the mailbox of the team mailbox,

436
00:25:22,650 --> 00:25:26,670
dump that to PST, and then I was
interrogating the PST through

437
00:25:26,670 --> 00:25:29,820
PowerShell to try and pull the
messages out, which actually did

438
00:25:29,820 --> 00:25:32,760
kind of work except the problem
was, I couldn't figure out how

439
00:25:32,760 --> 00:25:35,700
to link the threads together,
right. So I could pull out the

440
00:25:35,700 --> 00:25:37,710
individual messages, but they
would just be individual

441
00:25:37,710 --> 00:25:40,260
messages. They weren't threaded
in any way. They just have funky

442
00:25:40,260 --> 00:25:43,380
gooeys. And this doesn't seem to
be any key that links them

443
00:25:43,380 --> 00:25:46,140
together. So I reached out to to
Greg Sheridan, I was like, hey,

444
00:25:46,140 --> 00:25:49,560
Greg, here's what I'm trying to
do. I realized this is really

445
00:25:49,560 --> 00:25:52,800
weird, but I have a specific use
case that I need to work on. And

446
00:25:52,800 --> 00:25:56,340
this is what I need to do. And
he was like, Oh, I'm Lee has a

447
00:25:56,370 --> 00:25:58,680
script for that. I was like,
what really? He's like, yeah,

448
00:25:58,680 --> 00:26:02,220
check this out. And he sent me
your backup teams backup team

449
00:26:02,370 --> 00:26:06,480
script, which then just blew my
mind because it basically did

450
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:12,450
everything that I needed to do.
And so I guess one of the one of

451
00:26:12,450 --> 00:26:16,080
the things that I wanted to kind
of ask you was, you have a ton

452
00:26:16,080 --> 00:26:18,690
of stuff on your on your blog,
and to me Still, it's the go to

453
00:26:18,690 --> 00:26:21,720
resource for anyone who wants to
do any PowerShell stuff with

454
00:26:21,720 --> 00:26:25,920
teams, I always send them to
your blog comverse, the virtual

455
00:26:25,920 --> 00:26:28,470
conference that was on a couple
weeks ago, I actually presented

456
00:26:28,470 --> 00:26:31,380
a team's PowerShell. So
PowerShell session at the

457
00:26:31,380 --> 00:26:36,210
conference, and I demoed a bunch
of stuff. And I had like a whole

458
00:26:36,210 --> 00:26:39,900
block snippet of your scripted,
which was great. It was great.

459
00:26:40,200 --> 00:26:43,920
Yes. But, but I was and I kind
of sent everyone to your blogs,

460
00:26:43,920 --> 00:26:46,890
like, Look, if you need stuff
that involves PowerShell in

461
00:26:46,890 --> 00:26:51,000
teams, you got to go to Lee's
blog, right. Did you do you have

462
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:53,100
some sort of developer
background? I mean, we talked

463
00:26:53,100 --> 00:26:56,580
about you coming out of the PBX
world, but the way I think you

464
00:26:56,580 --> 00:26:59,640
approach a lot of the coding I
mean, it's it's it's it's

465
00:26:59,640 --> 00:27:02,160
actually pretty Incredible and
and you look at the stuff and

466
00:27:02,160 --> 00:27:04,590
you go this stuff was written by
someone who is, you know, a full

467
00:27:04,590 --> 00:27:06,690
time developer. But that's not
the case with you though,

468
00:27:06,600 --> 00:27:09,870
Lee Ford: right? No, it's
absolutely not afford, you know,

469
00:27:11,520 --> 00:27:15,390
there's bits that I would need
to do for paid work where, you

470
00:27:15,390 --> 00:27:17,580
know, we just need to script
something or write rapport or

471
00:27:17,580 --> 00:27:20,640
something like that. But
typically now it has been, I'm

472
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:26,400
doing other How do I do
something? Or I, I'm doing this

473
00:27:26,400 --> 00:27:29,310
thing. It's taken me a really
long, long amount of time to do

474
00:27:29,310 --> 00:27:32,370
manually. How can I script? How
can I automate it? And it is

475
00:27:32,370 --> 00:27:37,770
purely just a hobby is probably
not the right word. But it is

476
00:27:37,890 --> 00:27:41,850
just something I enjoy doing. I
like writing a bit of code. But

477
00:27:41,850 --> 00:27:43,740
certainly I'm not a formal
developer. I haven't been on any

478
00:27:43,740 --> 00:27:48,090
training courses or, you know,
my job title isn't developer. So

479
00:27:48,390 --> 00:27:53,550
it's purely just a passion for
wanting to do it really. And

480
00:27:53,910 --> 00:27:57,120
yeah, I quite enjoy buying a bit
of code.

481
00:27:57,420 --> 00:27:59,670
Chris Goosen: And so we fought I
think because I wanted to I want

482
00:27:59,670 --> 00:28:02,790
to I want But to kind of get
your thoughts on the, the graph

483
00:28:02,790 --> 00:28:06,900
PowerShell SDK, but before we
jump into that, do you mind just

484
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:09,900
running down or running through
a couple of the the scripts that

485
00:28:09,900 --> 00:28:13,230
you actually do have a new blog?
Just for folks, for folks who

486
00:28:13,230 --> 00:28:15,330
haven't come across your work
yet and are sitting there going,

487
00:28:15,330 --> 00:28:18,810
how am I going to solve this
problem? Because so you have the

488
00:28:18,810 --> 00:28:22,320
backup team script, right, which
is essentially just goes and

489
00:28:22,320 --> 00:28:24,720
interrogates the the org and I
haven't used it in in a little

490
00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:26,730
while now. But it goes
interrogate all the teams in the

491
00:28:26,730 --> 00:28:30,840
org and basically dumps all of
the content into an archive.

492
00:28:31,140 --> 00:28:35,220
Lee Ford: Right? Correct. Yes.
So what it will do is it will

493
00:28:35,220 --> 00:28:39,300
you log in to bonds, run the
PowerShell script, you log into

494
00:28:39,300 --> 00:28:41,580
it, and then it will list all
the teams within your tenant.

495
00:28:41,970 --> 00:28:44,100
And then you choose like I want
to backup this team or you want

496
00:28:44,100 --> 00:28:47,280
go actually I want to backup all
the teams. And then it will go

497
00:28:47,280 --> 00:28:50,250
through and it will grab the
team. It will download all the

498
00:28:50,280 --> 00:28:55,800
files within that team or the
chat history. And any settings

499
00:28:55,800 --> 00:28:59,520
that were set against the team
is basically anything within

500
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:04,140
that team. And puts in a zip
file like saying, including all

501
00:29:04,140 --> 00:29:06,900
the attachments. And what it
allows you to do then is

502
00:29:06,900 --> 00:29:09,810
actually, if you wanted to, you
could recreate that team on the

503
00:29:09,810 --> 00:29:15,330
same tenant or a different
tenant. And it will try and put

504
00:29:15,330 --> 00:29:19,260
the file upload the files back
into the team. And if it's the

505
00:29:19,260 --> 00:29:21,480
same tenant without the members
back in on the owners back end

506
00:29:21,480 --> 00:29:24,960
of that original team so it's
it's a way

507
00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:29,610
Warren du Toit: Why do I need to
go by F point then? Well,

508
00:29:29,820 --> 00:29:35,490
Lee Ford: no, no actually doing
any SLA. Your own risk, but

509
00:29:35,790 --> 00:29:40,830
yeah, I mean, it was kind of
just a, it's a, I was just

510
00:29:40,980 --> 00:29:43,740
thought this should be something
that's just built into the

511
00:29:43,740 --> 00:29:46,890
Amazon alphabet to just go on,
kind of capture this team

512
00:29:46,950 --> 00:29:50,220
download as a file as a backup.
And then you know, I've got that

513
00:29:50,220 --> 00:29:54,390
for for charity. And if that
team goes by, by by accident or

514
00:29:54,390 --> 00:29:58,110
whatever, then then you've got a
copy of it a set point. So

515
00:29:58,110 --> 00:30:02,160
that's kind of the need really
there. And yeah, it was it was

516
00:30:02,160 --> 00:30:05,130
great fun writing it to be able
to do it's written in

517
00:30:05,670 --> 00:30:09,330
PowerShell. With I think it's
just graph. I don't think

518
00:30:09,330 --> 00:30:13,260
there's any, any teams your
show, purely just graph.

519
00:30:15,330 --> 00:30:16,890
But not the SDK is impressive.

520
00:30:17,430 --> 00:30:19,170
Nicolas Blank: Yes. That's
awesome.

521
00:30:19,380 --> 00:30:21,840
Chris Goosen: And so in here's
why I think it's so cool. Right

522
00:30:21,840 --> 00:30:26,040
is because and again, I, you
know, my my history or knowledge

523
00:30:26,040 --> 00:30:28,020
on this is probably about six
months out of date now, because

524
00:30:28,020 --> 00:30:30,870
I haven't been doing migrations
for a little bit now with my new

525
00:30:30,870 --> 00:30:35,010
role. But historically, this
there's a challenge. There's

526
00:30:35,010 --> 00:30:37,290
been a challenge in getting
conversation history out of

527
00:30:37,290 --> 00:30:42,600
teams, right. There's no real
like, API that you can query, at

528
00:30:42,600 --> 00:30:45,060
least they never there wasn't, I
guess, at the time when you can

529
00:30:45,060 --> 00:30:49,740
query to get that data out or to
replay it. And so what I've seen

530
00:30:49,770 --> 00:30:54,780
certain vendors doing is their
approaches that they they use,

531
00:30:55,200 --> 00:30:59,400
there's a slack migration thing
that they use to replay the

532
00:30:59,400 --> 00:31:02,310
cart, the Conversations back.
But you lose all the metadata.

533
00:31:02,310 --> 00:31:06,420
So you end up having the the
author of the conversation have

534
00:31:06,420 --> 00:31:10,320
a very chat is whatever the
migration service account is.

535
00:31:10,470 --> 00:31:14,070
Right. And, and what's what's,
what was what's super sneaky

536
00:31:14,070 --> 00:31:19,560
about that is, is that when I
saw this demo, they had named a

537
00:31:19,560 --> 00:31:22,590
migration service account like a
person's name like john smith.

538
00:31:22,770 --> 00:31:27,030
That was every conversation
authored by john smith. john

539
00:31:27,030 --> 00:31:30,480
smith is our service account.
But that's, that's even worse.

540
00:31:32,250 --> 00:31:34,620
Lee Ford: Migration told us a
bit more obvious to know that

541
00:31:34,620 --> 00:31:35,940
Oh, yeah, this isn't actually

542
00:31:35,970 --> 00:31:38,160
Chris Goosen: exactly I just
feel like it's so sneaky because

543
00:31:38,160 --> 00:31:40,890
they they were trying to like,
I'm not accusing anyone of

544
00:31:40,890 --> 00:31:43,380
anything. I just feel like it
was kind of a way for them to

545
00:31:43,620 --> 00:31:46,710
not pay draw attention to the
fact that that and I picked up

546
00:31:46,710 --> 00:31:50,460
on a straightaway and so the
other approach obviously, she

547
00:31:50,460 --> 00:31:53,250
dumped everything into a file
archive like you like you do

548
00:31:53,250 --> 00:31:55,800
with an HTML file. That thing
can just be viewed later. Right.

549
00:31:55,800 --> 00:31:57,570
Which, which I think is is
pretty

550
00:31:58,560 --> 00:32:00,870
Lee Ford: sorry. That's That's
why Yeah. So it's just an HTML

551
00:32:00,870 --> 00:32:03,360
file and it almost looks like a
conversation, you've got sort of

552
00:32:03,360 --> 00:32:05,880
the, the chat bubbles, if you
want to think of it like that.

553
00:32:06,120 --> 00:32:09,720
And then you can kind of when
you look, okay, let's have a

554
00:32:09,720 --> 00:32:12,120
conversation history, you can
either open an HTML file or if

555
00:32:12,120 --> 00:32:15,420
you restore that team or
recreate that team, I guess,

556
00:32:15,810 --> 00:32:19,260
into into the tenant, it will
then be available. Yeah, within

557
00:32:19,260 --> 00:32:23,580
that team as an HTML file that
you can just open within teams

558
00:32:23,580 --> 00:32:25,920
and look at the previous
conversation history. So you're

559
00:32:25,920 --> 00:32:30,210
not gonna lying to anyone that
you know, that conversation took

560
00:32:30,210 --> 00:32:34,380
place naturally, you know, that
the previous conversations were

561
00:32:34,380 --> 00:32:38,190
in this fight if you do need to
get back and view them. So. But

562
00:32:38,220 --> 00:32:42,210
the main reason for that is more
just want to look at a team or

563
00:32:42,210 --> 00:32:44,550
look at the whole conversation
from a backup purposes rather

564
00:32:44,550 --> 00:32:45,450
than a recreation.

565
00:32:45,900 --> 00:32:47,640
Chris Goosen: Right? Yeah,
absolutely. And it makes a lot

566
00:32:47,640 --> 00:32:49,860
of sense, but I think there's
definitely sort of an

567
00:32:49,860 --> 00:32:55,290
application for it in backup
slash migration places as well,

568
00:32:55,290 --> 00:32:57,660
right? If you need to move
between tenants or whatever,

569
00:32:57,660 --> 00:33:01,980
this is a really handy way to
say where Here's what we can do,

570
00:33:01,980 --> 00:33:04,260
here's what we can't do. And we
can't give you an archive of all

571
00:33:04,260 --> 00:33:07,170
of that stuff. Because sometimes
the conversations in within the

572
00:33:07,170 --> 00:33:10,950
team are not super valuable to
anyone, like from a longevity

573
00:33:10,950 --> 00:33:13,440
perspective, right? Like
everyone's talking about their

574
00:33:13,440 --> 00:33:15,540
lunch order doesn't isn't
something that the business

575
00:33:15,540 --> 00:33:18,660
needs to keep. But there may be
some other conversations within

576
00:33:18,660 --> 00:33:20,760
a that are really handy. And so
be able to get them in that

577
00:33:20,760 --> 00:33:24,660
archive is, is pretty cool. So
yeah, thank you for that. There

578
00:33:24,660 --> 00:33:26,940
was another one, you have a just
a backup team's config one as

579
00:33:26,940 --> 00:33:27,240
well.

580
00:33:27,270 --> 00:33:29,100
Lee Ford: Right there. Yeah.
backuptrans config. Yeah. So

581
00:33:29,100 --> 00:33:34,230
that that effectively does a, it
uses the Skype online

582
00:33:34,230 --> 00:33:37,380
PowerShell. But you can also do
the team's on my power show now,

583
00:33:37,380 --> 00:33:40,110
but it basically connects via
PowerShell and downloads, all

584
00:33:40,110 --> 00:33:43,590
the configs and all the policies
and all pretty much any

585
00:33:43,590 --> 00:33:47,790
configurable option within teams
from a PowerShell point of view.

586
00:33:48,150 --> 00:33:51,630
And then you can download that
and it puts into another archive

587
00:33:51,630 --> 00:33:57,000
file. And then each type of
let's say, you know, there's a

588
00:33:57,000 --> 00:34:00,180
client policy or something about
you can open the HTML file. for

589
00:34:00,180 --> 00:34:03,540
that client policy and view it
kind of in in table format so

590
00:34:03,540 --> 00:34:06,060
it's a bit easier to view than
than looking through a

591
00:34:06,060 --> 00:34:11,580
PowerShell export. And what I've
also done is included the

592
00:34:11,580 --> 00:34:16,710
PowerShell exports the the CLA
XML files, which means that you

593
00:34:16,710 --> 00:34:21,090
can then go back and compare a
backup to a live service and it

594
00:34:21,090 --> 00:34:24,660
will go through line by line and
compare any differences so if

595
00:34:24,660 --> 00:34:26,880
you make someone's made a change
you can go well let's see what

596
00:34:26,880 --> 00:34:29,400
it was compared to this back
watch it two weeks ago Hang on a

597
00:34:29,400 --> 00:34:34,620
minute this is this this policy
has changed and now this value

598
00:34:34,620 --> 00:34:36,330
is set to true is now set to
false

599
00:34:36,750 --> 00:34:40,170
Warren du Toit: son of he's
gonna get fired that going chiz

600
00:34:40,410 --> 00:34:44,790
yeah salaries salaries are you
right at right

601
00:34:44,940 --> 00:34:50,130
Lee Ford: now? No, no, no. It's
all just my for my Yeah, just

602
00:34:50,160 --> 00:34:53,970
just just just keep it should be
changing. Yeah. So

603
00:34:55,650 --> 00:34:57,630
Nicolas Blank: anyway, you How
difficult was it for you to get

604
00:34:57,630 --> 00:35:00,840
going with graphs and moving
away from What PowerShell

605
00:35:00,840 --> 00:35:05,520
couldn't do is to dig around in
graph figuring out what you

606
00:35:05,610 --> 00:35:08,460
wanted to solve in terms of
problems, and then figuring out

607
00:35:08,460 --> 00:35:09,660
how to put that all together.

608
00:35:11,099 --> 00:35:12,929
Lee Ford: Yeah, it was a little
bit of a challenge to begin

609
00:35:12,929 --> 00:35:16,679
with, just because at the time,
there was no PowerShell SDK and

610
00:35:16,709 --> 00:35:20,369
not being a former developer,
now having to work out things

611
00:35:20,369 --> 00:35:25,709
like auth, and, you know,
authorization codes and tokens

612
00:35:25,709 --> 00:35:30,359
and all that sort of stuff to to
be able to log into graph. And,

613
00:35:30,659 --> 00:35:33,959
yeah, that took a little bit of
time, but it was worth it in the

614
00:35:33,959 --> 00:35:37,169
end. And it is certainly
something that I do find useful

615
00:35:37,169 --> 00:35:41,279
or almost on a daily basis to
know about so. But yeah, that

616
00:35:41,279 --> 00:35:43,529
that was the biggest challenge
was kind of getting into graph.

617
00:35:43,799 --> 00:35:48,239
Once you in graph. It's kind of
just like any other API really,

618
00:35:48,239 --> 00:35:52,289
you're sending requests to an
API with with a token saying,

619
00:35:52,289 --> 00:35:55,289
you know, I'm allowed to ask
this question and then you're

620
00:35:55,289 --> 00:35:59,189
getting data back or you know,
your push your or you're placing

621
00:35:59,189 --> 00:36:03,629
data or putting To in, in graph
and, you know, you get response

622
00:36:03,629 --> 00:36:07,919
back to, to that. So, yeah, that
that was a bit of a, from going

623
00:36:07,919 --> 00:36:10,289
from, you know, dedicated
commandlets that, you know,

624
00:36:10,289 --> 00:36:12,149
would have been pre built almost
having to create your own

625
00:36:12,149 --> 00:36:16,649
commandlets or your own custom
connections and things like

626
00:36:16,649 --> 00:36:20,159
that. Yeah, that that took a
little bit more time. Not coming

627
00:36:20,159 --> 00:36:22,169
from that, you know, background

628
00:36:24,540 --> 00:36:26,760
Warren du Toit: very cool. I
mean, I said, I'm gonna, like,

629
00:36:26,790 --> 00:36:29,160
go away completely off on a
tangent. Tell me about the

630
00:36:29,160 --> 00:36:32,760
spider man in the background.
I'm a huge Spider Man fan.

631
00:36:34,110 --> 00:36:34,920
Yeah.

632
00:36:37,980 --> 00:36:42,630
Lee Ford: I'm not actually. So
my Mike. Mike. My kids. I'm not

633
00:36:42,630 --> 00:36:43,890
really into sleep.

634
00:36:44,070 --> 00:36:46,650
Warren du Toit: Oh, he's a good
guy is gonna grow up to be a

635
00:36:46,650 --> 00:36:47,100
champ.

636
00:36:47,430 --> 00:36:51,900
Lee Ford: Yeah. Yeah, I'm not
really. Yeah, I'm not into

637
00:36:52,500 --> 00:36:54,540
super. Yeah, I'm probably
shouldn't be saying things like

638
00:36:54,540 --> 00:36:57,390
that. But I'll probably get
kicked off podcasts and things.

639
00:36:57,390 --> 00:37:01,860
But yeah, I'm not really into
superhero film. Or I've never

640
00:37:01,860 --> 00:37:04,560
seen Star Wars things.

641
00:37:04,710 --> 00:37:06,990
Warren du Toit: Yeah, no, it's
okay. Okay within them. There

642
00:37:06,990 --> 00:37:09,720
must be something that you're
into right like a conscious be

643
00:37:09,720 --> 00:37:10,260
graph.

644
00:37:10,830 --> 00:37:13,290
Lee Ford: Yeah Now watch graph
movies. Yeah, yeah.

645
00:37:15,839 --> 00:37:16,529
I

646
00:37:17,009 --> 00:37:18,599
Warren du Toit: see your
YouTube.

647
00:37:19,289 --> 00:37:21,779
Lee Ford: Yeah, I just watched
YouTube tutorials every day, but

648
00:37:24,180 --> 00:37:26,100
it's not quite like
documentaries and

649
00:37:27,660 --> 00:37:31,680
yeah, science fiction I think.
So I probably should watch Star

650
00:37:31,680 --> 00:37:35,430
Wars but yeah, things like that.
You know, I'm happy to watch

651
00:37:35,430 --> 00:37:38,820
that but yeah, superhero movies
I've tried I have tried but it

652
00:37:38,820 --> 00:37:39,990
just didn't do it for me.

653
00:37:41,790 --> 00:37:46,230
Chris Goosen: So again, getting
back to slight tangent screw.

654
00:37:46,950 --> 00:37:51,780
Well, let's get back, get back
to graph. I think what you've

655
00:37:51,780 --> 00:37:55,590
said is kind of exactly been my
experience right because I like

656
00:37:55,590 --> 00:37:58,860
you I don't really have any
formal development background

657
00:37:58,860 --> 00:38:02,340
but I I'm a mentor As a fan of
automation in PowerShell, and I

658
00:38:02,340 --> 00:38:05,520
literally like if, if I could
find a job where all I did was

659
00:38:05,520 --> 00:38:08,190
just PowerShell to it like all
day long, I'd be super happy. It

660
00:38:08,190 --> 00:38:10,920
was quite funny I was. This is
just a little little story.

661
00:38:10,920 --> 00:38:15,240
Yeah, Nick and I were at Ignite
one year, and we were talking to

662
00:38:15,240 --> 00:38:20,550
a mutual friend of ours, dog.
And I and I just met him. And I

663
00:38:20,550 --> 00:38:22,710
didn't really know what he did.
And we started talking, he was

664
00:38:22,710 --> 00:38:25,380
like, Oh, I like PowerShell. I
said, Yeah, I said, Why I wish I

665
00:38:25,380 --> 00:38:27,660
wish I could find a job, or I
just did PowerShell all day

666
00:38:27,660 --> 00:38:30,540
long. And he was like, that's my
job. That's what I do. And he

667
00:38:30,540 --> 00:38:33,870
actually ends up, you know,
running a whole bunch, you know,

668
00:38:33,930 --> 00:38:38,250
he had a company that he did,
started to build some apps and

669
00:38:38,250 --> 00:38:41,160
stuff. And it was all PowerShell
based, which is very cool. But I

670
00:38:41,160 --> 00:38:45,510
also find it really hard and
really difficult to when you

671
00:38:45,510 --> 00:38:48,570
start working with JSON and
having to kind of parse and

672
00:38:48,570 --> 00:38:51,780
construct those queries, it
becomes really difficult or can

673
00:38:51,780 --> 00:38:56,550
be interesting, right to learn.
But then I, you know, with the,

674
00:38:56,700 --> 00:39:01,260
the the, the graph PowerShell
SDK, that's come out In the last

675
00:39:01,350 --> 00:39:04,290
six months or so, that's made
that significantly easier

676
00:39:04,290 --> 00:39:08,700
because now, I feel like you
have all of the graph magic

677
00:39:09,600 --> 00:39:13,620
without any of the, you know,
having to construct, you know,

678
00:39:13,650 --> 00:39:20,850
invoke web request. Right. Have
you found that? I mean, I've

679
00:39:20,850 --> 00:39:23,160
seen you've been doing some some
work with it and on it and I

680
00:39:23,160 --> 00:39:25,920
think you actually have some
tutorial videos on Yeah, as

681
00:39:25,920 --> 00:39:26,220
well.

682
00:39:26,280 --> 00:39:28,650
Lee Ford: Yeah, I think I have a
getting started video and and

683
00:39:28,680 --> 00:39:32,910
just, yeah, an accompanying blog
post. And it's pretty good.

684
00:39:32,910 --> 00:39:36,840
Actually, it takes away a lot of
the playing Previously, we had

685
00:39:36,840 --> 00:39:40,320
to work out how to authenticate
with graph using PowerShell. And

686
00:39:41,100 --> 00:39:45,030
you don't have to do any of that
you used to be type Connect pipe

687
00:39:45,030 --> 00:39:49,380
and graph and say what I'm doing
graph you have these things

688
00:39:49,380 --> 00:39:52,230
called scopes, which kind of
permissions what what do I want

689
00:39:52,230 --> 00:39:56,820
to have access to in graph you
specify those, and then you log

690
00:39:56,820 --> 00:39:59,970
in with the device code like you
do on other PowerShell modules.

691
00:40:00,360 --> 00:40:03,360
You connect it and that's it.
And then you can just run, you

692
00:40:03,360 --> 00:40:06,720
know, get typhon mg user or
something like that. So it's I

693
00:40:06,720 --> 00:40:10,920
was always mg prefix, but bit
like there is a CS prefix with

694
00:40:10,920 --> 00:40:15,660
Skype and teams. And
effectively, yeah, takes away a

695
00:40:15,660 --> 00:40:22,560
lot of the guesswork and kind of
how to construct like, say, JSON

696
00:40:22,560 --> 00:40:28,380
objects to post. And when you're
requesting data is literally

697
00:40:28,380 --> 00:40:31,770
just writing that it feels much
more natural as from a

698
00:40:31,770 --> 00:40:35,430
PowerShell point of view while
they're doing to kind of create

699
00:40:35,430 --> 00:40:39,480
your own wrapper, but photograph
now i think it's it's very, very

700
00:40:39,480 --> 00:40:42,090
useful. Really cool. I do
probably need to put it into

701
00:40:42,090 --> 00:40:45,300
some of my scripts actually,
because I need to go back and

702
00:40:45,300 --> 00:40:48,870
update them to use the module.
But no, it's super cool. I don't

703
00:40:48,870 --> 00:40:53,850
think it's 1.0 just yet, but
they are working on it and yeah,

704
00:40:53,880 --> 00:40:56,100
it's improving all the time. And
it's super cool.

705
00:40:56,519 --> 00:40:59,579
Chris Goosen: Yeah, I definitely
the I really like it and what i

706
00:40:59,609 --> 00:41:02,519
what i love about it is that I,
because I'm a Mac user, I can do

707
00:41:02,519 --> 00:41:06,179
everything on my Mac now. Right?
Like I don't I mean, I still do.

708
00:41:06,179 --> 00:41:10,439
But I technically I don't need a
VM to be able to do things

709
00:41:10,439 --> 00:41:13,919
anymore because I can take, I
can access all of graph through

710
00:41:13,919 --> 00:41:16,529
this module that runs great in
PowerShell Core, and I can do it

711
00:41:16,529 --> 00:41:18,689
straight up my Mac. And that was
part of the demo that I did on

712
00:41:18,689 --> 00:41:22,589
the converse was taking, I took
a script that another MVP,

713
00:41:22,589 --> 00:41:26,579
Nathan O'Brien had written. And
I ported it to use what I bought

714
00:41:26,579 --> 00:41:31,559
it as much of it as I could to
use the the SDK, and then I ran

715
00:41:31,559 --> 00:41:34,859
the one in Windows, and then I
ran the other one on on my Mac.

716
00:41:35,309 --> 00:41:37,559
And it's for one, it's
significantly quicker, right to

717
00:41:37,559 --> 00:41:42,719
run and versus the module. But
it's fantastic stuff. I'm super

718
00:41:42,719 --> 00:41:45,299
excited by that. I'm struggling
a little bit with the lack of

719
00:41:45,299 --> 00:41:48,929
documentation on some things,
because it's not, you know, it's

720
00:41:48,929 --> 00:41:52,379
not as easy to find. If you
know, if you want to interrogate

721
00:41:52,379 --> 00:41:54,899
a particular property somewhere
to go and find exactly how you

722
00:41:54,899 --> 00:41:57,839
do that, you kind of have to dig
through the the API reference

723
00:41:57,839 --> 00:42:00,119
and then try and work it out. At
least that's how I've been Been

724
00:42:00,119 --> 00:42:00,659
doing it but

725
00:42:00,690 --> 00:42:04,440
Lee Ford: grass was only a
module of the SDK for the SDK?

726
00:42:04,440 --> 00:42:09,270
Yes. So the the SDK isn't sort
of hand built. It's it's, it's

727
00:42:09,270 --> 00:42:12,240
kind of auto generated, right? I
can't I think it might be called

728
00:42:12,240 --> 00:42:15,300
Open API or something like that,
where they they use a method

729
00:42:15,300 --> 00:42:18,870
where it's kind of looking at a
graph and working at all right,

730
00:42:18,870 --> 00:42:21,360
there's a, there's a graph
endpoint for user. Okay, based

731
00:42:21,360 --> 00:42:24,780
on that I can create a list of
commandlets to wrap around that

732
00:42:24,780 --> 00:42:27,330
that API call. So they're not
having to write each command

733
00:42:27,330 --> 00:42:30,120
line manually. I think there are
literally are thousands of them.

734
00:42:31,200 --> 00:42:34,050
So so you're probably going to
struggle to get documentation

735
00:42:34,050 --> 00:42:36,570
like you would, let's say, with
a traditional PowerShell module

736
00:42:36,570 --> 00:42:41,430
has been written by someone.
It's It's so that's Yeah, where

737
00:42:41,430 --> 00:42:43,830
you're going to struggle. I
think you kind of almost looking

738
00:42:43,830 --> 00:42:47,100
to look at the graph API
reference to work out what the

739
00:42:47,100 --> 00:42:52,470
object is going to be when you
when you run your request. And

740
00:42:52,740 --> 00:42:56,010
kind of work backwards from
there really, so yeah,

741
00:42:56,250 --> 00:42:58,080
Chris Goosen: yeah, that's,
that's, I guess that's been my

742
00:42:58,080 --> 00:43:01,980
approach of trying to kind of
figure it out. And eventually

743
00:43:01,980 --> 00:43:04,560
we'll kind of get to that way of
thinking, I think it's just a,

744
00:43:04,950 --> 00:43:07,620
it's a familiarity thing, right?
You know, if you're looking to

745
00:43:07,620 --> 00:43:10,950
find anything related to a user
be, you know, in the in the

746
00:43:10,950 --> 00:43:13,290
Azure module, it'd be, you know,
get Azure AD user, and it's

747
00:43:13,290 --> 00:43:16,320
going to be a property in there
somewhere. But it doesn't, it

748
00:43:16,320 --> 00:43:19,740
doesn't translate like that to
the SDK, you can't do get mg

749
00:43:19,740 --> 00:43:22,260
user and see all of us and
properties. Sometimes you have

750
00:43:22,260 --> 00:43:26,760
to query a different command I
found but I think once we start

751
00:43:26,760 --> 00:43:29,880
wrapping our head around that,
it's, it's just gonna be super

752
00:43:29,880 --> 00:43:33,360
because now it really becomes
cross platform. And that's

753
00:43:33,360 --> 00:43:37,290
really good for me. So I want to
kind of move any future scripts

754
00:43:37,290 --> 00:43:40,380
I write all the same here to to
do that. Yes, it just seems to

755
00:43:40,380 --> 00:43:41,460
make a lot more sense. So

756
00:43:42,600 --> 00:43:46,080
Warren du Toit: XML as long as
XML is out of the picture Life

757
00:43:46,080 --> 00:43:48,450
is good. I'll take JSON or XML

758
00:43:49,950 --> 00:43:52,500
Lee Ford: Yeah, I think it's
moving that way, isn't it? It's

759
00:43:52,500 --> 00:43:56,280
It's It's all JSON and open
standards and annex one is an

760
00:43:56,280 --> 00:43:59,100
open standard, but it's, yeah,
everything's everything's

761
00:43:59,100 --> 00:44:02,940
heading that way. And Things
like what you say have been not

762
00:44:02,970 --> 00:44:05,730
fixed. I've got to use Windows
PowerShell. For this module, you

763
00:44:05,730 --> 00:44:09,690
know, I think slowly but surely
that's moving away. Like in the

764
00:44:09,960 --> 00:44:12,330
team's preview PowerShell
module, they've added the

765
00:44:12,540 --> 00:44:15,960
bilytica Skype for Business. So
you can use in Skype for

766
00:44:15,960 --> 00:44:19,380
Business PowerShell using core
by then empties Windows

767
00:44:19,380 --> 00:44:21,960
PowerShell. So they are moving
slowly, which is common.

768
00:44:24,030 --> 00:44:27,000
Nicolas Blank: So we're coming
up to the top of the show. And

769
00:44:27,030 --> 00:44:32,190
before we let you go, I would
like to ask you, what is it that

770
00:44:32,190 --> 00:44:36,450
you'd like to plug either in
terms of Twitter handles, blogs?

771
00:44:37,080 --> 00:44:39,720
Anything else that you'd like to
call out? Absolutely. Nothing

772
00:44:39,720 --> 00:44:42,030
goes as long as we get a cut of
it.

773
00:44:42,240 --> 00:44:45,330
Lee Ford: Yeah, of course. And
so yeah, you can you can follow

774
00:44:45,330 --> 00:44:53,070
me on Twitter. My Twitter handle
is @lee_ford. And my blog is

Diversity and inclusion in tech was one of the powerful themes at Microsoft Ignite this year and I'm [excited to see if get bigger every year](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/ignite/diversityandtech). Nicolas had the distinct privilege of being able to sit down with Phoummala Schmitt, a.k.a Exchange Goddess to talk about diversity in tech, community and her new role at Microsoft.

The episode was also sketched by the wonderfully [talented Luise Freese.](https://twitter.com/LuiseFreese) [![](/assets/images/uploads/2018/10/IMG_0094.jpg){:height="768px" width="1024px"}](/assets/images/uploads/2018/10/IMG_0094.jpg)

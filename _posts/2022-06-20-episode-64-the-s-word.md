We recently had a lot of fun connecting with Koos Goossens to talk about Microsoft Sentinel. Koos has a wealth of knowledge and shared some great tips on getting started with Sentinel, the importance of cost management and why a product != process.

<img src="/assets/images/uploads/2022/06/koos.jpeg" alt="Koos" class="img-left"> . Koos Goossens is passionate about all things Microsoft Cloud and Security related. In his current role. he has been focussing on implementing Microsoft Sentinel and improving Security Operation Centers by helping with the development of new detections and fine-tuning, but also applying processes for automatic enrichments and investigations. KQL and Azure Logic Apps are two of my new best friends. You can connect with Koos on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/koos-goossens/) and can also check him out on [Medium](https://medium.com/@koosg)

It's 2021! Well, technically it's been 2021 for three months and it looks like many of the trends established in 2020 are continuing - not only in our daily lives but also from a cyber threat perspective. In this episode we sit down with Donovan Stevens to talk about account takeovers (ATO) - what it is, why it is something you may want to pay attention to and what you can do to help safeguard against it.

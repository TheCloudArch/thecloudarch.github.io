In this milestone 100th episode, we sit down with Daniel Brown, a Microsoft MVP based in Adelaide, to explore how AI is transforming the rugged world of opal mining. Daniel shares the fascinating story of how he developed Opal AI, a computer vision system that uses Microsoft’s Custom Vision and Azure services to identify precious opals in the harsh environment of Coober Pedy. By leveraging AI to detect opal, and safety hazards in real-time, Daniel demonstrates how edge computing can bring tangible efficiency and safety improvements to a traditionally manual industry.

The discussion delves into the practical challenges of deploying AI in the Australian outback, from using black light properties for opal detection to dealing with connectivity limitations that require robust offline edge processing. Daniel explains how he built and refined his models with over 5,000 tagged images, sharing practical advice for others looking to start their own AI projects using tools like customvision.ai with as few as 15 starter images.

Beyond the technical insights, the episode captures the intersection of ancient geology and cutting-edge technology, highlighting how AI can uncover treasures that are over 100 million years old while automating and securing mining operations.

We also celebrate our 100th episode, reflecting on nine years of community-driven conversations, learning, and evolving alongside the cloud ecosystem.

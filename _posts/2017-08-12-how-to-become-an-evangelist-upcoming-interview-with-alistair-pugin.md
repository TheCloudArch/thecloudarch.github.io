This Episode is going to be a bit different from the norm. We're going to speak to an "evangelist," not a religious guy on a soap box, but a technical evangelist who started as a technology consultant, but made a conscious career change to become something different. The questions that we want to ask are towards the career development of anyone who wishes to do the same thing. One caveat that I'll note now is that many of us are in evangelist positions technologically speaking however we are not aware of the impact we provide. That leaves us open to what we can't measure is what we can't manage. This post is an invitation to post your questions that we will ask of our guest on the show. For ease of visibility, we would ask that instead of commenting on this post, you avail yourself of our Facebook Group at [https://www.facebook.com/thearchitects.cloud/](https://www.facebook.com/thearchitects.cloud/).

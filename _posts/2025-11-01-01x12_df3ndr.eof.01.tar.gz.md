📍 *Live from Times Square, New York City* 🇺🇸
This was the **first edition of Experts Live in the United States**, and we couldn't be more proud to be part of it!

> We wrap up Season One with a **special in-person recording** from Microsoft’s office in NYC during **Experts Live US**.  
> No planning, no script – just good conversation, best practices, and bad Sentinel acronyms. 😉
> Chris and Koos will both be talking about their sessions they gave at the event. Chris will discuss securitu baseline best-practices. And Koos will be sharing Sentinel tips from the field.

## 🔐 *Security Baselines in Microsoft 365*

Chris brought a fresh look at building, maintaining, and automating **security baselines** in M365 environments.

### Why Baselines Matter

Not all security risks come from attackers—some come from **insecure defaults** and **configuration drift**. Chris explains the difference between:

* **Baseline risk** – inherent misconfigurations or risky defaults (e.g., Teams external messaging or anonymous sharing)
* **Threat actor risk** – malicious activity like phishing, token theft, brute force attacks

> *"Most users don’t go in and change things. They just assume someone smarter than them chose the settings that are best for them...”*
>
> *"The tyranny of the default"* - Steve Gibson

### The Security Baseline Lifecycle

Chris walked through his five-step model:

1. **Assess** – Understand where your current security posture stands (warts and all)
2. **Define** – Choose a framework (CIS, NIST, ISO) and define your secure baseline
3. **Implement** – Put the controls and processes in place
4. **Monitor** – Watch for drift and misconfigurations over time
5. **Improve** – Feed real-world lessons back into your process

### Tools & Demos

Chris demoed several tools including:

* **M365 Maester Toolkit** – By Merill Fernando & community
* **MaesterDiff** – Track baseline drift over time
* **Azure Automation** – Run Maester weekly & notify via Teams/Email
* **MCP Server** – Future potential for integrating with detection/response pipelines

> Start small. Focus on one domain (e.g., identity) and iterate.

## 🌊 *Getting the Most Bang for Your Logs – Again!*

Koos couldn't help himself—he brought **more Sentinel content**, including some **very practical demos** and updates on **data lake**, **MCP Server**, and cost-saving strategies.

### Sentinel Cost Optimization

Koos shared a story from that *very morning* where a customer accidentally enabled Sentinel on an operational Log Analytics workspace—leading to an **unnecessary €2,000/month bill**. That's why it's important to really understand the pricing model and be aware of the different discounts that are available.

### Automate Commitment Tier Management

Koos a plethora of practical tips and tricks from the field he gathered during the last years.

* Architecture decisions are more important than you'd think
* Automatically scale **commitment tiers** based on past 90-day usage
* Use Azure Monitor to trigger on cost spikes to prevent unpleasant surprises at the end of the month
* Leverage **SCU (Sentinel Commitment Units)** *(another SCU acronym, thanks Microsoft)*;-) with pre-payment plans for even higher discounts

### Sentinel data lake

Not just that Scooby-Doo meme but an actual game-changer: **Sentinel data lake**.

* Simple setup (no DCRs/DCEs)
* Raw log mirroring from Sentinel
* Long-term storage + post-ingestion querying
* Asset tables — great for incident correlation

### GitHub Copilot + data lake = Magic?

Koos previewed how GitHub Copilot can now query the Sentinel data lake using **natural language KQL** via **MCP Server** in **VS Code**:

> “Give me all Graph activity from an app with this display name…”  
> Copilot brute-forced the `AppId` collection based of a DisplayName and generated a working query, pretty wild.

Some caveats:

* GitHub Copilot **not aware** of Asset Tables (yet)
* Limited to **VS Code**
* **Costs still apply** when querying data lake

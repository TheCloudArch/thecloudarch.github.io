Anything from connected light bulbs and door bells to sensors that monitor and report the drying and curing of concrete in real time, there seems to be an IoT solution for every problem but IoT is so much more than just a sensor connected to a Raspberry PI. Microsoft's Anthony Bartolo sat down with us at Ignite to explain what IoT is, why IT Pros should pay attention and how to get started. Here are some of the links mentioned in the episode:

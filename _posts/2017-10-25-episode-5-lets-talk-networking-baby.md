If there is anything we've learned about Office 365 in the last few years, it's that change is inevitable. Not only are the core workloads and services changing constantly, but there are also new features and services added to Office 365 on a regular basis and as a result of this the service as a whole continues to evolve. At Ignite recently, we caught up with Paul Andrew and Paul Collinge from the Office 365 product group to talk about Microsoft's impressive and ever-evolving network and how connectivity and network guidance has changed over time.

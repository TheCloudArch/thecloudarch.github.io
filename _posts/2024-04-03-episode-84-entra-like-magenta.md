"Back by popular demand" - even if they do say so themselves! In this episode we are excited to welcome back to the show Tarek Dawoud and Mark Morowczynski from Microsoft's Identity CXP team. We discuss the current state of Identity and dive into Conditional Access, phish-resistant MFA, the latest threats and why attacks only get better, they never get worse. Tarek and Mark share some great tool tips and we close the episode by talking about Mark's new KQL book and how KQL is fast becoming an essential skill.

If you follow the Microsoft productivity space, you have no doubt seen or heard about the [Autodiscovering the Great Leak](https://www.guardicore.com/labs/autodiscovering-the-great-leak/) research paper recently published by Amit Serper, a security researcher at Guardicore. The paper details more than five months' research into the Autodiscover service used by Microsoft Exchange. Amit's research was picked up and in many instances misreported by the tech press, which in turn caused a certain degree of panic. We're deeply passionate about Exchange and have been for a very long time, so we thought it would be a good idea to sit down with Amit to talk through his research and better understand his findings.

During the episode, Amit talks about the following resources:

*   [DetectionLab](https://detectionlab.network)
*   [Monitoring TLDs vulnerable to autodiscover leaks](https://autodiscover-vulnerable-tlds.com)

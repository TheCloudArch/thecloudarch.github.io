2020 has been an interesting and very different year for most of us. We're doing more things online than ever before - Microsoft recently announced that Teams reached 115 million daily active users, but this new normal extends well beyond the business world. There are countless positive stories of how technology has helped teachers connect with students or doctors connect with patients, but there are some not-so-positive consequences too. In this episode, Anna, Nic and Warren talk about Microsoft Ignite that took place recently and explore the concept of digital fatigue and how to set some boundaries (or lay your pipes) to help protect your mental health.

This involves driving partnerships between engineering and marketing that influence product roadmaps and leading community strategy to enable best practice sharing between customers - in turn facilitating a natural feedback loop between the people who build Microsoft Office products and services and the people who implement them.

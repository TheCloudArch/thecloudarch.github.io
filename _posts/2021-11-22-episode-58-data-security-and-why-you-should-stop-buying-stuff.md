Data Security is top of mind for many organizations at the moment with so many of them transitioning to a permanent work from home or hybrid working model. There is however so much more to protecting your data than encrypting it or implementing a DLP tool. In this episode we have a great conversation with Ernie Anderson about Data Security - what it is, where to start, what to consider and why you shouldn't just run out and buy a tool right away.

![Ernie](/images/uploads/2021/11/ernie.jpg){:style="float: left;margin-right: 10px;margin-top: 10px;" height="150px" width="150px"} Ernie Anderson has over 20 years of professional experience in Information Technology, of which 19 have been focused on cybersecurity consulting. He has a proven track record of working with cross-industry Chief Information Security Officers (“CISOs”) and Chief Information Officers (“CIOs”) to define cybersecurity strategies and establish risk-driven cybersecurity programs that are both enablers of the business and a value proposition to customers. Ernie’s technical foundation enables him to translate strategic vision into tactical solutions and implementation projects. He currently leads Kudelski Security's Services practice, which includes strategic leadership and the development of capabilities, staff planning, opportunity identification and capture, and the delivery of projects.

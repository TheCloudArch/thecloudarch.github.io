We're Back! Yes! it's been a little while since we last recorded an episode. Needless to say, the COVID-19 situation globally upset our planned travel and recording schedule just a little. We hope you and yours are keeping safe and well during these crazy times.

In this episode we delve into Cybersecurity, something that has been very topical for many organizations as they have been forced to operate remotely during COVID-19. Our guest, Francisco Donoso helps unpack and explain some common security concepts and shares the top three things you can do to help your organization be safer in today's cyber world.

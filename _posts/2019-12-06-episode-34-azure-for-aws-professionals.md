With the explosive growth of cloud services, many organizations suddenly find themselves having to manage multiple cloud environments, either intentionally or by coincidence due to mergers, acquisitions or other such events. With Azure and AWS being two of the most popular choices, we talk to Azure MVP Mike Pfeiffer who is also AWS certified about the parallels between the two services, things to consider when running two clouds and discuss if multi-cloud makes more sense as a transitional state or long-term mode of operation.

![Mike](/images/uploads/2019/12/mike.jpg){:style="float: left;margin-right: 10px;margin-top: 10px;" height="150px" width="150px"} Mike is a twenty-year tech industry veteran and entrepreneur. He's worked for some of the largest software companies in the world, including Microsoft and Amazon Web Services (AWS), and has launched two successful consulting businesses since 2003.

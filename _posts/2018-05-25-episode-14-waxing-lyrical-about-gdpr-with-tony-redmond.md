The [General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Data_Protection_Regulation) has been on everyone's mind recently. GDPR became enforceable today, 25 May 2018 and is a regulation in EU law on data protection and privacy for all individuals within the European Union. It also addresses the export of personal data outside the EU and aims primarily to give control to citizens and residents over their personal data and how that data is used. It seems a lot a organizations left their GDPR strategies to the very last minute - I received a lot of GDPR related email this week! What does it all mean and why should we care? We had the pleasure of talking to Tony Redmond about it recently. ![](http://thearchitects.cloud/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/tony-150x150.jpg)Tony Redmond has been writing about electronic mail since 1992 and is widely regarded as one of the foremost commentators on Microsoft collaboration technology. Tony has written 15 books and is the lead author of [Office 365 for IT Pros](https://www.amazon.com/Office-365-Pros-4th-Comprehensive-ebook/dp/B071FQTKTG) which is the most practical and up-to-date guide to everything Office 365 related I've come across - and it is updated weekly.

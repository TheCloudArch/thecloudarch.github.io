The word DevOps seems to be everywhere at the moment, I can't open LinkedIn without coming across a bunch of posts and articles talking about DevOps. What does it all mean, and more specifically why should IT Pros care about something that seems at first glance to be very much related to software development? I recently caught up with fellow MVPs [Simon Waight](https://blog.siliconvalve.com) and [Michel de Rooij](https://eightwone.com) in an attempt to understand what it is and why it is something worth paying attention to. ![](http://thearchitects.cloud/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/simon-150x150.jpg) Simon Waight is an Azure MVP from Australia who's career focus has been on the building of online software solutions resulting in a deep understanding of the technologies used and challenges faced when working in this space.

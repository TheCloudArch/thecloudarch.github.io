Governance is a big word and is a concept that is often thrown around. It seems to confuse a lot of organizations, even those who have successfully navigated the cultural and technology changes often brought on by cloud adoption. The 'on by default' nature of many cloud services has made it even more important for organizations to plan their governance strategy before adopting these services, so we sat down with Antonio Maio to talk about the need for governance and why it isn't something that should be overlooked.

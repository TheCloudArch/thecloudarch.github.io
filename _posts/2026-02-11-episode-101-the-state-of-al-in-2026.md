In Episode 101 of the Cloud Architects Podcast, we welcome Microsoft AI MVP James Westall for a candid “state of the nation” discussion on AI in 2026. Moving beyond the LLM hype of 2024 and the agent frenzy of 2025, the conversation explores what’s actually delivering value for organizations today and what isn’t. We unpack common pitfalls like oversold expectations, poor use case selection, and the challenge of measuring ROI, while highlighting practical success stories. We also tackle model “religion wars,” cost realities, developer productivity, and the importance of strategy and governance.

Shortly before Thanksgiving, Nic and I had the great pleasure of talking to John Kindervag. I once read about John that he has "forgotten more about technology than most people learn in their careers" and I'm sure after listening to this episode you'll understand why he is referred to as the Godfather Of Zero Trust. In this episode we discuss the origins of Zero Trust and some of the history behind it. John also talks about why trying to control the attack surface is a fool's errand and introduces the concept of a protect surface.

![John](/images/uploads/2023/12/john.jpeg){:style="float: left;margin-right: 10px;margin-top: 10px;" height="150px" width="150px"} With over 25 years of experience as a practitioner and industry analyst, John Kindervag is one of the worldâ€™s foremost cybersecurity experts and is known for creating the transformational Zero Trust Model of cybersecurity.

Have you heard the story of malware that targets programmable logic controllers (PLCs) on industrial systems and causing fast-spinning centrifuges to tear themselves apart? How about the disgruntled employee in Australia who tampered with a supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) system and released 265,000 gallons (~1M l) of sewage from a waste management plant? In this episode we're joined by Operational Technology (OT) Security expert Roger Hill as we discuss OT security, the convergence of OT and IT and how we can defend against OT / IOT attacks.

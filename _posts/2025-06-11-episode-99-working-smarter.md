In this episode we are joined by guest Kirsty McGrath, a Microsoft MVP and adoption expert, for an insightful conversation on working smarter in today’s AI-driven workplace. Kirsty shares her extensive experience leading adoption programs across Australia and consulting with top Microsoft clients, offering practical wisdom on the importance of user training and change management in maximizing the impact of tools like Microsoft Copilot.

The episode delves into the common confusion users face when navigating Microsoft 365’s vast ecosystem—especially with tools that overlap or are frequently updated. Kirsty emphasizes that adoption isn’t just about assigning licenses; it's about helping people understand, trust, and effectively use technology. She also about the psychological and organizational barriers to change—how emotional comfort zones can prevent users from embracing new tools, and why strong change management can significantly reduce help desk pressure and improve employee satisfaction

We had the pleasure of finally welcoming Martina Grom to the podcast. The Cloud Architects have followed and collaborated with the incredible Martina for many years. 
In this episode, Warren learns some German :) We also discuss Microsoft Viva and some different views on the product, as well as Martina's history and how she got her love for the cloud.
Please enjoy this incredible episode with Martina.

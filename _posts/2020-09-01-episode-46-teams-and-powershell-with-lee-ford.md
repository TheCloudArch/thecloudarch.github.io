Microsoft Teams has seen some incredible growth in recent months as many organizations worldwide adjust to a new normal that involves a remote, work from home workforce. In late April, Microsoft announced that it had seen a 70% increase in Teams usage, increasing to more than 75 million daily active users and seeing 200 million meeting participants in a single day for the first time. In this episode, we talk to MVP Lee Ford about his experience working with Teams, adoption of Teams features such as direct routing and some really handy PowerShell scripts he's written.

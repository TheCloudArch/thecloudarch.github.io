In this episode, we introduce our listeners to our new co-host Chris Goosen about massive migrations to Exchange Online... What is massive? 400,000 users are massive. We speak to Chris about things like networking, adoption and not defeating the rules of physics when migrating from on-premises or even tenant to tenant, as well as what to do with multiple workloads like One Drive for Business and Skype for Business.

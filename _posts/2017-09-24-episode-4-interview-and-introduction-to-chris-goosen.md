In this episode, we introduce our listeners to our new co-host Chris Goosen and talk about massive migrations to Exchange Online... What is massive? 400,000 users massive. We speak to Chris about things like networking, adoption and not defeating the rules of physics when migrating from on-premises or even tenant to tenant, as well as what to do with multiple workloads like OneDrive for Business and Skype for Business.

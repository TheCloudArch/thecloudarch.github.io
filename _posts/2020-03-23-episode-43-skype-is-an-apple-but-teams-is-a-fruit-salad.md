There is no denying the ever-increasing popularity of Microsoft Teams. Microsoft recently reported an unprecedented spike in Teams usage due to the ongoing COVID-19 situation, with usage rising to more than 44 million daily users - showing an increase of 12 million users over the course of just seven days. When I sat down with fellow MVPs Paul Bloem and Andrew Morpeth in Auckland, New Zealand last month, we would never have predicted the current work from home situation that most of us find ourselves in at the moment. We did however talk about their favorite new Teams features, social contracts, Teams modes and of course the adoption of various features and functionality in Teams.

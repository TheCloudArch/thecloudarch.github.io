The telecommunications industry has come a long way since the days of manual service telephone exchanges. We caught up with fellow MVP Greig Sheridan late last year to talk about Skype for Business, Teams and the evolution in technology he has experienced in his 30+ years in the industry.

<img src="/assets/images/uploads/2018/02/greig2.jpg" alt="Greig" class="img-left"> Greig has worked in the telecommunications industry in Sydney, Australia, since finishing high school in the 1980s. Having entered the industry as an Apprentice Technician with Telecom Australia, he’s the “Practice Lead - UC” for Generation-e, a leading Microsoft partner with a focus on the modern workplace, UC and Audio-Visual solutions.

We've all been prompted to create a Passkey when logging in to online services like Google - but are Passkeys ready for enterprise use? Do we still need MFA? What's is FIDO2? We asked Microsoft MVP Darren Robinson to help us dive into the world of Passkeys & verifiable credentials. Darren helps us understand the different types of Passkeys, their use-cases and, he shares some strategies for dealing with those pesky legacy apps and authentication protocols.

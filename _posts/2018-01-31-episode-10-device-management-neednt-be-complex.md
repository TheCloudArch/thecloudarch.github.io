Mobility has been a hot topic for some time - in fact, [IDC forecasts](https://www.idc.com/research/viewtoc.jsp?containerId=US41678216) that the U.S. mobile worker population will surpass 105 million by 2020. Organizations often struggle when trying to provide flexibility and a choice of devices on the one hand and retain control of sensitive data and security on the other. We sat down with fellow MVP Steve Goodman at Microsoft Ignite late last year to discuss a simplistic approach to implementing Device Management and why it needn't be so complex.

The Microsoft Office 365 Hybrid Configuration Wizard (HCW) has come a long way since it was first introduced in Exchange 2010 SP2, prior to that configuring a hybrid deployment required ~50 manual steps. We had the pleasure of sitting down with Greg Taylor and Georgia Huggins while in Redmond recently to talk about the evolution of the HCW and what challenges the newly released Hybrid Agent solves for customers.

She has experience working with both small and large enterprise customers and designing, building and delivering features based on their needs. Georgia also spent many years managing, testing and supporting Exchange Server in pre-production and production environments for Microsoft Information Technology groups.
